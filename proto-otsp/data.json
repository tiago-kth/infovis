For decades, Herriot roamed the remote, beautiful Yorkshire Dales, treating every patient that came his way from smallest to largest, and observing animals and humans alike with his keen, loving eye.In All Creatures Great and Small, we meet the young Herriot as he takes up his calling and discovers that the realities of veterinary practice in rural Yorkshire are very different from the sterile setting of veterinary school. Some visits are heart-wrenchingly difficult, such as one to an old man in the village whose very ill dog is his only friend and companion, some are lighthearted and fun, such as Herriot's periodic visits to the overfed and pampered Pekinese Tricki Woo who throws parties and has his own stationery, and yet others are inspirational and enlightening, such as Herriot's recollections of poor farmers who will scrape their meager earnings together to be able to get proper care for their working animals. From seeing to his patients in the depths of winter on the remotest homesteads to dealing with uncooperative owners and critically ill animals, Herriot discovers the wondrous variety and never-ending challenges of veterinary practice as his humor, compassion, and love of the animal world shine forth.James Herriot's memoirs have sold 80 million copies worldwide, and continue to delight and entertain readers of all ages","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1393644607i/32085.jpg","asin":"0312965788","isbn":"0312965788","isbn13":"9780312965785","publisher":"St. Martin's Press","ratingsCount":138113,"reviewsCount":6292,"numPages":437,"language":"English","rank":302,"year_publication":1972,"list_score":47733,"number_votes":629,"genres_list":"Biography, Humor, Memoir, British Literature, Animals, Autobiography, Classics, Audiobook, Nonfiction, Biography Memoir","authors_list":"James Herriot","series_list":"All Creatures Great and Small","places_list":"Yorkshire, England","awards_list":"Audie Award","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":true,"Childrens":false,"Classics":true,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":false,"Historical":false,"Historical Fiction":false,"Literature":false,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":true,"Novels":false,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":4.33,"filename":"book0003.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12000020-aristotle-and-dante-discover-the-secrets-of-the-universe","title":"Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe","titleComplete":"Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe (Aristotle and Dante, #1)","description":"Dante can swim.

When it was published in serial form in 1905, it was a full third longer than the censored, commercial edition published in book form the following year. That expurgated commercial edition edited out much of the ethnic flavor of the original, as well as some of the goriest descriptions of the meat-packing industry and much of Sinclair's most pointed social and political commentary. The text of this new edition is as it appeared in the original uncensored edition of 1905. It contains the full 36 chapters as originally published, rather than the 31 of the expurgated edition. A new foreword describes the discovery in the 1980s of the original edition and its subsequent suppression, and a new introduction places the novel in historical context by explaining the pattern of censorship in the shorter commercial edition.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1332140681i/41681.jpg","asin":"1884365302","isbn":"1884365302","isbn13":"9781884365300","publisher":"See Sharp Press","ratingsCount":139183,"reviewsCount":6691,"numPages":335,"language":"English","rank":499,"year_publication":1905,"list_score":21008,"number_votes":292,"genres_list":"Historical Fiction, School, American, Politics, Historical, Fiction, Classic Literature, Classics, Novels, Literature","authors_list":"Earl Lee, Upton Sinclair, Kathleen DeGrave","series_list":"","places_list":"Illinois, Chicago, Illinois","awards_list":"","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":false,"Childrens":false,"Classics":true,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":true,"Historical":true,"Historical Fiction":true,"Literature":true,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":true,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":3.76,"filename":"book0005.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/179064.The_Goose_Girl","title":"The Goose Girl","titleComplete":"The Goose Girl (The Books of Bayern, #1)","description":"She was born with her eyes closed and a word on her tongue, a word she could not taste.Her name was Anidori-Kiladra Talianna Isilee, Crown Princess of Kildenree, and she spent the first years of her life listening to her aunt’s stories and learning the language of the birds, especially the swans.

Our 1940s heroes are the brilliant mathematician Lawrence Waterhouse, crypt analyst extraordinaire, and gung-ho, morphine-addicted marine Bobby Shaftoe. They're part of Detachment 2702, an Allied group trying to break Axis communication codes while simultaneously preventing the enemy from figuring out that their codes have been broken. Their job boils down to layer upon layer of deception. Dr. Alan Turing is also a member of 2702, and he explains the unit's strange workings to Waterhouse. \"When we want to sink a convoy, we send out an observation plane first... Of course, to observe is not its real duty—we already know exactly where the convoy is. Its real duty is to be observed... Then, when we come round and sink them, the Germans will not find it suspicious.\"All of this secrecy resonates in the present-day story line, in which the grandchildren of the WWII heroes—inimitable programming geek Randy Waterhouse and the lovely and powerful Amy Shaftoe—team up to help create an offshore data haven in Southeast Asia and maybe uncover some gold once destined for Nazi coffers. To top off the paranoiac tone of the book, the mysterious Enoch Root, key member of Detachment 2702 and the Societas Eruditorum, pops up with an unbreakable encryption scheme left over from WWII to befuddle the 1990s protagonists with conspiratorial ties.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327931476i/816.jpg","publisher":"Avon","ratingsCount":108034,"reviewsCount":5790,"numPages":1152,"language":"English","rank":795,"year_publication":1999,"list_score":10193,"number_votes":122,"genres_list":"Historical Fiction, Science Fiction Fantasy, Historical, Fiction, War, Thriller, Novels, Fantasy, Science Fiction, Cyberpunk","authors_list":"Neal Stephenson","series_list":"","places_list":"Southeast Asia, The Philippines, Bletchley Park, Buckinghamshire, England","awards_list":"Hugo Award, Prometheus Hall of Fame Award, Locus Award, Arthur C.

Then, the unspeakable: a night of chaos and carnage gives way to sunrise on a nation, and ultimately a world, forever altered. All that remains for the stunned survivors is the long fight ahead and a future ruled by fear—of darkness, of death, of a fate far worse.As civilization swiftly crumbles into a primal landscape of predators and prey, two people flee in search of sanctuary. FBI agent Brad Wolgast is a good man haunted by what he's done in the line of duty. Six-year-old orphan Amy Harper Bellafonte is a refugee from the doomed scientific project that has triggered apocalypse. Wolgast is determined to protect her from the horror set loose by her captors, but for Amy, escaping the bloody fallout is only the beginning of a much longer odyssey—spanning miles and decades—toward the time an place where she must finish what should never have begun.With The Passage, award-winning author Justin Cronin has written both a relentlessly suspenseful adventure and an epic chronicle of human endurance in the face of unprecedented catastrophe and unimaginable danger.

Asher Lev is an artist who is compulsively driven to render the world he sees and feels, even when it leads him to blasphemy. In this stirring and often visionary novel, Chaim Potok traces Asher’s passage between these two identities, the one consecrated to God, the other subject only to the imagination.Asher Lev grows up in a cloistered Hasidic community in postwar Brooklyn, a world suffused by ritual and revolving around a charismatic Rebbe.

Now, installed in her old bedroom in her family's Victorian mansion, Camille finds herself identifying with the young victims—a bit too strongly. Dogged by her own demons, she must unravel the psychological puzzle of her own past if she wants to get the story—and survive this homecoming.Librarian's Note: this is an alternate cover edition - ISBN 10: 0307341550 (ISBN 13: 9780307341556)","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1475695315i/18045891.jpg","publisher":"Broadway Paperbacks","ratingsCount":905037,"reviewsCount":56421,"numPages":254,"language":"English","rank":781,"year_publication":2006,"list_score":10490,"number_votes":124,"genres_list":"Contemporary, Mystery, Crime, Horror, Fiction, Thriller, Mystery Thriller, Suspense, Audiobook, Adult","authors_list":"Gillian Flynn","series_list":"","places_list":"Wind Gap, Missouri, Missouri, Chicago, Illinois","awards_list":"Barry Award, CWA New Blood Dagger, Edgar Award, CWA Ian Fleming Steel Dagger","Adult":true,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":true,"Childrens":false,"Classics":false,"Contemporary":true,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":true,"Historical":false,"Historical Fiction":false,"Literature":false,"Magic":false,"Mystery":true,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":false,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":true,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":4.01,"filename":"book0924.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7728.Antigone","title":"Antigone","titleComplete":"Antigone (The Theban Plays, #3)","description":"The curse placed on Oedipus lingers and haunts a younger generation in this new and brilliant translation of Sophocles' classic drama.

Renowned classicist Bernard Knox observes in his superb introduction that although the violence of the Iliad is grim and relentless, it coexists with both images of civilized life and a poignant yearning for peace. Combining the skills of a poet and scholar, Robert Fagles, winner of the PEN/Ralph Manheim Medal for Translation and a 1996 Academy Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, brings the energy of contemporary language to this enduring heroic epic. He maintains the drive and metric music of Homer’s poetry, and evokes the impact and nuance of the Iliad’s mesmerizing repeated phrases in what Peter Levi calls “an astonishing performance.”","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1625333695i/1371.jpg","asin":"B00A2KEJ5A","isbn":"0140275363","isbn13":"9780140275360","publisher":"Penguin Classics","ratingsCount":418647,"reviewsCount":10123,"numPages":704,"language":"English","rank":771,"year_publication":-800,"list_score":10642,"number_votes":142,"genres_list":"Historical Fiction, School, Greek Mythology, War, Fiction, Classics, Mythology, Fantasy, Literature, Poetry","authors_list":"Robert Fagles, Richmond Lattimore, Homer, Prentiss Cummings, R.

His stunning first novel, The Notebook, has been given by friend to friend and lover to lover all over the world as a testament to the timeless power of love. But if we thought he could never again move us so deeply, he now shows us he can-in a story that renews our faith in destiny...in the ability of true lovers to find each other no matter where, no matter when... Message In A Bottle Thrown to the waves, and to fate, the bottle could have ended up anywhere. Instead, it is found just three weeks after it begins its journey. Theresa Osborne, divorced and the mother of a twelve-year-old son, picks it up during a seaside vacation from her job as a Boston newspaper columnist. Inside is a letter that opens with: My Dearest Catherine, I miss you my darling, as I always do, but today is particularly hard because the ocean has been singing to me, and the song is that of our life together... For \"Garrett,\" the man who signs the letter, the message is the only way he knows to express his undying love for a woman he has lost. For Theresa, wary of romance since her husband shattered her trust, the message raises questions that intrigue her. Who are Garrett and Catherine? Where is he now? What is his story? Challenged by the mystery, and pulled to find Garrett by emotions she does not fully understand, Theresa begins a search that takes her to a sunlit coastal town and an unexpected confrontation. Brought together by chance-or something more powerful-Theresa and Garrett are people whose lives are about to touch for a purpose, in a tale that resonates with our deepest hopes for finding that special someone and everlasting love. Shimmering with suspense and emotional intensity, Message in a Bottle takes readers on a hunt for the truth about a man and his memories, and about both the heartbreaking fragility and enormous strength of love. For those who cherished The Notebook and readers waiting to discover the magic of Nicholas Sparks's storytelling, here is his new, achingly lovely novel of happenstance, desire, and the choices that matter most...","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1163789140i/3478.jpg","asin":"0446676071","isbn":"0446676071","isbn13":"9780446676076","publisher":"Warner Books","ratingsCount":230329,"reviewsCount":4753,"numPages":342,"language":"English","rank":751,"year_publication":1998,"list_score":11051,"number_votes":160,"genres_list":"Contemporary, Adult Fiction, Adult, Drama, Fiction, Contemporary Romance, Novels, Chick Lit, Love, Romance","authors_list":"Nicholas Sparks","series_list":"","places_list":"Wilmington, North Carolina, North Carolina","awards_list":"","Adult":true,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":false,"Childrens":false,"Classics":false,"Contemporary":true,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":true,"Historical":false,"Historical Fiction":false,"Literature":false,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":true,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":true,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":3.97,"filename":"book0955.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3805.The_Corrections","title":"The Corrections","titleComplete":"The Corrections","description":"\"The Corrections\" is a grandly entertaining novel for the new century - a comic, tragic masterpiece about a family breaking down in an age of easy fixes.After almost fifty years as a wife and mother, Enid Lambert is ready to have some fun. Unfortunately, her husband, Alfred, is losing his sanity to Parkinson's disease, and their children have long since flown the family nest to the catastrophes of their own lives. The oldest, Gary, a once-stable portfolio manager and family man, is trying to convince his wife and himself, despite clear signs to the contrary, that he is not clinically depressed. The middle child, Chip, has lost his seemingly secure academic job and is failing spectacularly at his new line of work. And Denise, the youngest, has escaped a disastrous marriage only to pour her youth and beauty down the drain of an affair with a married man - or so her mother fears. Desperate for some pleasure to look forward to, Enid has set her heart on an elusive goal: bringing her family together for one last Christmas at home. Stretching from the Midwest at midcentury to the Wall Street and Eastern Europe of today, \"The Corrections\" brings an old-fashioned world of civic virtue and sexual inhibitions into violent collision with the era of home surveillance, hands-off parenting, do-it-yourself mental healthcare, and globalised greed. Richly realistic, darkly hilarious, deeply humane, it confirms Jonathan Franzen as one of our most brilliant interpreters of American society and the American soul.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1355011305i/3805.jpg","asin":"1841156736","isbn":"1841156736","isbn13":"9781841156736","publisher":"Fourth Estate Paperbacks","ratingsCount":174446,"reviewsCount":10634,"numPages":653,"language":"English","rank":750,"year_publication":2001,"list_score":11054,"number_votes":150,"genres_list":"Contemporary, Adult Fiction, American, Fiction, Novels, Literary Fiction, The United States Of America, Audiobook, Family, Literature","authors_list":"Jonathan Franzen","series_list":"","places_list":"St. Jude, Illinois","awards_list":"Pulitzer Prize, National Book Award, James Tait Black Memorial Prize, PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction, Audie Award, Los Angeles Times Book Prize, National Book Critics Circle Award, International Dublin Literary Award","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":true,"Childrens":false,"Classics":false,"Contemporary":true,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":true,"Historical":false,"Historical Fiction":false,"Literature":true,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":true,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":3.82,"filename":"book0956.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7770.One_Fish_Two_Fish_Red_Fish_Blue_Fish","title":"One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish","titleComplete":"One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish","description":"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish is a 1960 children's book by Dr. Seuss (Theodor Seuss Geisel).

Renée, the concierge, is witness to the lavish but vacuous lives of her numerous employers. Outwardly she conforms to every stereotype of the concierge: fat, cantankerous, addicted to television. Yet, unbeknownst to her employers, Renée is a cultured autodidact who adores art, philosophy, music, and Japanese culture. With humor and intelligence she scrutinizes the lives of the building's tenants, who for their part are barely aware of her existence. Then there's Paloma, a twelve-year-old genius. She is the daughter of a tedious parliamentarian, a talented and startlingly lucid child who has decided to end her life on the sixteenth of June, her thirteenth birthday. Until then she will continue behaving as everyone expects her to behave: a mediocre pre-teen high on adolescent subculture, a good but not an outstanding student, an obedient if obstinate daughter. Paloma and Renée hide both their true talents and their finest qualities from a world they suspect cannot or will not appreciate them. They discover their kindred souls when a wealthy Japanese man named Ozu arrives in the building. Only he is able to gain Paloma's trust and to see through Renée's timeworn disguise to the secret that haunts her.

On a cold March night New York Times reporter John Schuyler Moore is summoned to the East River by his friend and former Harvard classmate Dr. Laszlo Kreizler, a psychologist, or \"alienist.\" On the unfinished Williamsburg Bridge, they view the horribly mutilated body of an adolescent boy, a prostitute from one of Manhattan's infamous brothels.The newly appointed police commissioner, Theodore Roosevelt, in a highly unorthodox move, enlists the two men in the murder investigation, counting on the reserved Kreizler's intellect and Moore's knowledge of New York's vast criminal underworld. They are joined by Sara Howard, a brave and determined woman who works as a secretary in the police department. Laboring in secret (for alienists, and the emerging discipline of psychology, are viewed by the public with skepticism at best), the unlikely team embarks on what is a revolutionary effort in criminology-- amassing a psychological profile of the man they're looking for based on the details of his crimes. Their dangerous quest takes them into the tortured past and twisted mind of a murderer who has killed before--and will kill again before the hunt is over.Fast-paced and gripping, infused with a historian's exactitude, The Alienist conjures up the Gilded Age and its untarnished underside: verminous tenements and opulent mansions, corrupt cops and flamboyant gangsters, shining opera houses and seamy gin mills. Here is a New York during an age when questioning society's belief that all killers are born, not made, could have unexpected and mortal consequences.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388256626i/40024.jpg","asin":"0812976142","isbn":"0812976142","isbn13":"9780812976144","publisher":"Random House","ratingsCount":166889,"reviewsCount":8169,"numPages":498,"language":"English","rank":735,"year_publication":1994,"list_score":11471,"number_votes":164,"genres_list":"Historical Fiction, Mystery, Historical Mystery, Crime, Historical, Fiction, Thriller, Mystery Thriller, Suspense, Horror","authors_list":"Caleb Carr","series_list":"Dr. Laszlo Kreizler","places_list":"New York City, New York","awards_list":"Anthony Award, Grand Prix de Littérature Policière, Lambda Literary Award, Palle Rosenkrantz Prisen","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":false,"Childrens":false,"Classics":false,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":true,"Historical":true,"Historical Fiction":true,"Literature":false,"Magic":false,"Mystery":true,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":false,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":true,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":4.06,"filename":"book0970.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7864437-the-death-cure","title":"The Death Cure","titleComplete":"The Death Cure (The Maze Runner, #3)","description":"It’s the end of the line.

It came to be associated with the group of writers known as the Beat Generation, which included Jack Kerouac and William S. Burroughs. There is no foundation to the myth that \"Howl\" was written as a performance piece and later published by poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti of City Lights Books. This myth was perpetuated by Ferlinghetti as part of the defense's case during the poem's obscenity trial, as detailed below. Upon the poem's release, Ferlinghetti and the bookstore's manager, Shigeyoshi Murao, were charged with disseminating obscene literature, and both were arrested. On October 3, 1957, Judge Clayton W. Horn ruled that the poem was not obscene.

What do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common? Why do drug dealers still live with their moms? How much do parents really matter? What kind of impact did Roe v. Wade have on violent crime? Freakonomics will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.These may not sound like typical questions for an economist to ask. But Steven D. Levitt is not a typical economist. He is a much heralded scholar who studies the stuff and riddles of everyday life -- from cheating and crime to sports and child rearing -- and whose conclusions regularly turn the conventional wisdom on its head. He usually begins with a mountain of data and a simple, unasked question. Some of these questions concern life-and-death issues; others have an admittedly freakish quality. Thus the new field of study contained in this book: freakonomics.Through forceful storytelling and wry insight, Levitt and co-author Stephen J. Dubner show that economics is, at root, the study of incentives -- how people get what they want, or need, especially when other people want or need the same thing. In Freakonomics, they set out to explore the hidden side of ... well, everything. The inner workings of a crack gang. The truth about real-estate agents. The myths of campaign finance. The telltale marks of a cheating schoolteacher. The secrets of the Ku Klux Klan.What unites all these stories is a belief that the modern world, despite a surfeit of obfuscation, complication, and downright deceit, is not impenetrable, is not unknowable, and -- if the right questions are asked -- is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking. Steven Levitt, through devilishly clever and clear-eyed thinking, shows how to see through all the clutter.Freakonomics establishes this unconventional premise: If morality represents how we would like the world to work, then economics represents how it actually does work. It is true that readers of this book will be armed with enough riddles and stories to last a thousand cocktail parties. But Freakonomics can provide more than that. It will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.(front flap)","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1550917827i/1202.jpg","asin":"0061234001","isbn":"0061234001","isbn13":"9780061234002","publisher":"William Morrow","ratingsCount":814285,"reviewsCount":18282,"numPages":268,"language":"English","rank":722,"year_publication":2005,"list_score":11790,"number_votes":154,"genres_list":"Finance, Social Science, Science, Psychology, Politics, Business, Audiobook, Sociology, Nonfiction, Economics","authors_list":"Steven D.

She is caught off-guard by a young hunter who invades her most private spaces and confounds her self-assured, solitary life. On a farm several miles down the mountain, Lusa Maluf Landowski, a bookish city girl turned farmer's wife, finds herself unexpectedly marooned in a strange place where she must declare or lose her attachment to the land that has become her own. And a few more miles down the road, a pair of elderly feuding neighbors tend their respective farms and wrangle about God, pesticides, and the possibilities of a future neither of them expected.Over the course of one humid summer, these characters find their connections to one another and to the flora and fauna with whom they share a place.

Dr Iannis practices medicine on the island of Cephalonia, accompanied by his daughter, Pelagia, to whom he imparts much of his healing art. Even when the Italians do invade, life isn’t so bad—at first anyway. The officer in command of the Italian garrison is the cultured Captain Antonio Corelli, who responds to a Nazi greeting of “Heil Hitler” with his own “Heil Puccini”, and whose most precious possession is his mandolin. It isn't long before Corelli and Pelagia are involved in a heated affair--despite her engagement to a young fisherman, Mandras, who has gone off to join Greek partisans. Love is complicated enough in wartime, even when the lovers are on the same side. And for Corelli and Pelagia, it becomes increasingly difficult to negotiate the minefield of allegiances, both personal and political, as all around them atrocities mount, former friends become enemies and the ugliness of war infects everyone it touches. British author Louis de Bernières is well known for his forays into magical realism in such novels as The War of Don Emmanuel's Nether Parts, Señor Vivo and the Coca Lord and The Troublesome Offspring of Cardinal Guzman. Here he keeps it to a minimum, though certainly the secondary characters with whom he populates his island—the drunken priest, the strongman, the fisherman who swims with dolphins—would be at home in any of his wildly imaginative Latin American fictions. Instead, de Bernières seems interested in dissecting the nature of history as he tells his ever-darkening tale from many different perspectives. Captain Corelli’s Mandolin works on many levels, as a love story, a war story and a deconstruction of just what determines the facts that make it into the history books.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1479680795i/3388.jpg","asin":"067976397X","isbn":"067976397X","isbn13":"9780679763970","publisher":"Vintage","ratingsCount":83563,"reviewsCount":3227,"numPages":437,"language":"English","rank":718,"year_publication":1994,"list_score":11905,"number_votes":161,"genres_list":"Historical Fiction, War, Fiction, Historical, Classics, Novels, Romance, Greece, Literature, World War II","authors_list":"Louis de Bernières","series_list":"","places_list":"Cephallonia, Greece","awards_list":"Commonwealth Writers' Prize","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":false,"Childrens":false,"Classics":true,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":true,"Historical":true,"Historical Fiction":true,"Literature":true,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":true,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":true,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":4,"filename":"book0986.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18300212-the-trigger","title":"The Trigger: Hunting the Assassin Who Brought the World to War","titleComplete":"The Trigger: Hunting the Assassin Who Brought the World to War","description":"On a summer morning in Sarajevo a hundred years ago, a teenage assassin named Gavrilo Princip fired not just the opening shots of the First World War but the starting gun for modern history, when he killed Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Yet the events Princip triggered were so monumental that his own story has been largely overlooked, his role garbled and motivations misrepresented.The Trigger puts this right, filling out as never before a figure who changed our world and whose legacy still has an impact on all of us today. Born a penniless backwoodsman, Princip’s life changed when he trekked through Bosnia and Serbia to attend school. As he ventured across fault lines of faith, nationalism and empire, so tightly clustered in the Balkans, radicalisation slowly transformed him from a frail farm boy into history’s most influential assassin.By retracing Princip’s journey from his highland birthplace, through the mythical valleys of Bosnia to the fortress city of Belgrade and ultimately Sarajevo, Tim Butcher illuminates our understanding both of Princip and the places that shaped him. Tim uncovers details about Princip that have eluded historians for a century and draws on his own experience, as a war reporter in the Balkans in the 1990s, to face down ghosts of conflicts past and present.The Trigger is a rich and timely work that brings to life both the moment the world first went to war and an extraordinary region with a potent hold over history.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388535774i/18300212.jpg","asin":"070118793X","isbn":"070118793X","isbn13":"9780701187934","publisher":"Chatto  Windus","ratingsCount":3883,"reviewsCount":275,"numPages":352,"language":"English","rank":717,"year_publication":2014,"list_score":11919,"number_votes":123,"genres_list":"Biography, Politics, War, 20th Century, Historical, European History, World War I, Nonfiction, History, Travel","authors_list":"Tim Butcher","series_list":"","places_list":"","awards_list":"","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":false,"Childrens":false,"Classics":false,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":false,"Historical":true,"Historical Fiction":false,"Literature":false,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":true,"Novels":false,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":3.78,"filename":"book0987.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19547856-simon-vs-the-homo-sapiens-agenda","title":"Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda","titleComplete":"Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda (Simonverse, #1)","description":"Sixteen-year-old and not-so-openly gay Simon Spier prefers to save his drama for the school musical.

Yet something is lacking in her life. Inside her is a void so deep that nothing could possibly ever fill it. So, on the morning of November 11, 1997, Veronika decides to die. She takes a handful of sleeping pills expecting never to wake up.Naturally Veronika is stunned when she does wake up at Villete, a local mental hospital, where the staff informs her that she has, in fact, partially succeeded in achieving her goal. While the overdose didn't kill Veronika immediately, the medication has damaged her heart so severely that she has only days to live.The story follows Veronika through the intense week of self-discovery that ensues. To her surprise, Veronika finds herself drawn to the confinement of Villete and its patients, who, each in his or her individual way, reflect the heart of human experience. In the heightened state of life's final moments, Veronika discovers things she has never really allowed herself to feel before: hatred, fear, curiosity, love, and sexual awakening. She finds that every second of her existence is a choice between living and dying, and at the eleventh hour emerges more open to life than ever before.In Veronika Decides to Die, Paulo Coelho takes the reader on a distinctly modern quest to find meaning in a culture overshadowed by angst, soulless routine, and pervasive conformity. Based on events in Coelho's own life, Veronika Decides to Die questions the meaning of madness and celebrates individuals who do not fit into patterns society considers to be normal. Poignant and illuminating, it is a dazzling portrait of a young woman at the crossroads of despair and liberation, and a poetic, exuberant appreciation of each day as a renewed opportunity.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348139939i/1431.jpg","asin":"0061124265","isbn":"0061124265","isbn13":"9780061124266","publisher":"Harper Perennial","ratingsCount":206618,"reviewsCount":10044,"numPages":210,"language":"English","rank":706,"year_publication":1998,"list_score":12268,"number_votes":152,"genres_list":"Contemporary, Drama, Psychology, Fiction, Philosophy, Classics, Novels, Mental Health, Romance, Literature","authors_list":"Margaret Jull Costa, Paulo Coelho","series_list":"On the Seventh Day ","places_list":"Ljubljana","awards_list":"","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":false,"Childrens":false,"Classics":true,"Contemporary":true,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":true,"Historical":false,"Historical Fiction":false,"Literature":true,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":true,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":true,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":3.72,"filename":"book1002.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15783514-the-ocean-at-the-end-of-the-lane","title":"The Ocean at the End of the Lane","titleComplete":"The Ocean at the End of the Lane","description":"Sussex, England. A middle-aged man returns to his childhood home to attend a funeral. Although the house he lived in is long gone, he is drawn to the farm at the end of the road, where, when he was seven, he encountered a most remarkable girl, Lettie Hempstock, and her mother and grandmother. He hasn't thought of Lettie in decades, and yet as he sits by the pond (a pond that she'd claimed was an ocean) behind the ramshackle old farmhouse, the unremembered past comes flooding back. And it is a past too strange, too frightening, too dangerous to have happened to anyone, let alone a small boy.Forty years earlier, a man committed suicide in a stolen car at this farm at the end of the road. Like a fuse on a firework, his death lit a touchpaper and resonated in unimaginable ways. The darkness was unleashed, something scary and thoroughly incomprehensible to a little boy. And Lettie—magical, comforting, wise beyond her years—promised to protect him, no matter what.A groundbreaking work from a master, The Ocean at the End of the Lane is told with a rare understanding of all that makes us human, and shows the power of stories to reveal and shelter us from the darkness inside and out. It is a stirring, terrifying, and elegiac fable as delicate as a butterfly's wing and as menacing as a knife in the dark.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1497098563i/15783514.jpg","asin":"0062255657","isbn":"0062255657","isbn13":"9780062255655","publisher":"William Morrow Books","ratingsCount":569842,"reviewsCount":55068,"numPages":181,"language":"English","rank":700,"year_publication":2013,"list_score":12455,"number_votes":147,"genres_list":"Science Fiction Fantasy, Adult Fiction, Adult, Audiobook, Paranormal, Fiction, Young Adult, Fantasy, Horror, Magical Realism","authors_list":"Neil Gaiman","series_list":"","places_list":"England, Sussex, England","awards_list":"Nebula Award, Locus Award, World Fantasy Award, Mythopoeic Fantasy Award, Specsavers National Book Award, Goodreads Choice Award","Adult":true,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":true,"Childrens":false,"Classics":false,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":true,"Fiction":true,"Historical":false,"Historical Fiction":false,"Literature":false,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":false,"Paranormal":true,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":true,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":true,"avgRating":4.01,"filename":"book1003.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6882.Papillon","title":"Papillon","titleComplete":"Papillon","description":"Henri Charrière, called \"Papillon,\" for the butterfly tattoo on his chest, was convicted in Paris in 1931 of a murder he did not commit.

After planning and executing a series of treacherous yet failed attempts over many years, he was eventually sent to the notorious prison, Devil's Island, a place from which no one had ever escaped . . . until Papillon. His flight to freedom remains one of the most incredible feats of human cunning, will, and endurance ever undertaken.Charrière's astonishing autobiography, Papillon, was published in France to instant acclaim in 1968, more than twenty years after his final escape. Since then, it has become a treasured classic -- the gripping, shocking, ultimately uplifting odyssey of an innocent man who simply would not be defeated.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327865561i/6882.jpg","asin":"0061120669","isbn":"0061120669","isbn13":"9780061120664","publisher":"William Morrow Paperbacks","ratingsCount":65990,"reviewsCount":2559,"numPages":544,"language":"English","rank":702,"year_publication":1969,"list_score":12364,"number_votes":171,"genres_list":"Biography, Memoir, Crime, History, Autobiography, Biography Memoir, Classics, France, Nonfiction, Adventure","authors_list":"Henri Charrière","series_list":"Papillon","places_list":"Paris, French Guiana, Devil's Island, France","awards_list":"","Adult":false,"Adventure":true,"Audiobook":false,"Childrens":false,"Classics":true,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":false,"Historical":false,"Historical Fiction":false,"Literature":false,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":true,"Novels":false,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":4.22,"filename":"book1004.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47989.Night_Watch","title":"Night Watch","titleComplete":"Night Watch (Discworld, #29; City Watch, #6)","description":"Commander Sam Vimes of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch had it all.

Told in a style that magnificently captures the colloquialisms and clichés of the 1930s and 1940s, The Blind Assassin is a richly layered and uniquely rewarding experience.It opens with these simple, resonant words: \"Ten days after the war ended, my sister drove a car off the bridge.\" They are spoken by Iris, whose terse account of her sister Laura's death in 1945 is followed by an inquest report proclaiming the death accidental. But just as the reader expects to settle into Laura's story, Atwood introduces a novel-within-a-novel. Entitled The Blind Assassin, it is a science fiction story told by two unnamed lovers who meet in dingy backstreet rooms. When we return to Iris, it is through a 1947 newspaper article announcing the discovery of a sailboat carrying the dead body of her husband, a distinguished industrialist.For the past twenty-five years, Margaret Atwood has written works of striking originality and imagination. In The Blind Assassin, she stretches the limits of her accomplishments as never before, creating a novel that is entertaining and profoundly serious. The Blind Assassin proves once again that Atwood is one of the most talented, daring, and exciting writers of our time.

Like his masterly, Pulitzer Prize-winning biography Truman, David McCullough's John Adams has the sweep and vitality of a great novel. It is both a riveting portrait of an abundantly human man and a vivid evocation of his time, much of it drawn from an outstanding collection of Adams family letters and diaries. In particular, the more than one thousand surviving letters between John and Abigail Adams, nearly half of which have never been published, provide extraordinary access to their private lives and make it possible to know John Adams as no other major American of his founding era. As he has with stunning effect in his previous books, McCullough tells the story from within -- from the point of view of the amazing eighteenth century and of those who, caught up in events, had no sure way of knowing how things would turn out. George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, John Jay, the British spy Edward Bancroft, Madame Lafayette and Jefferson's Paris \"interest\" Maria Cosway, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, the scandalmonger James Callender, Sally Hemings, John Marshall, Talleyrand, and Aaron Burr all figure in this panoramic chronicle, as does, importantly, John Quincy Adams, the adored son whom Adams would live to see become President. Crucial to the story, as it was to history, is the relationship between Adams and Jefferson, born opposites -- one a Massachusetts farmer's son, the other a Virginia aristocrat and slaveholder, one short and stout, the other tall and spare. Adams embraced conflict; Jefferson avoided it. Adams had great humor; Jefferson, very little. But they were alike in their devotion to their country. At first they were ardent co-revolutionaries, then fellow diplomats and close friends. With the advent of the two political parties, they became archrivals, even enemies, in the intense struggle for the presidency in 1800, perhaps the most vicious election in history. Then, amazingly, they became friends again, and ultimately, incredibly, they died on the same day -- their day of days -- July 4, in the year 1826. Much about John Adams's life will come as a surprise to many readers. His courageous voyage on the frigate Boston in the winter of 1778 and his later trek over the Pyrenees are exploits that few would have dared and that few readers will ever forget. It is a life encompassing a huge arc -- Adams lived longer than any president. The story ranges from the Boston Massacre to Philadelphia in 1776 to the Versailles of Louis XVI, from Spain to Amsterdam, from the Court of St. James's, where Adams was the first American to stand before King George III as a representative of the new nation, to the raw, half-finished Capital by the Potomac, where Adams was the first President to occupy the White House. This is history on a grand scale -- a book about politics and war and social issues, but also about human nature, love, religious faith, virtue, ambition, friendship and betrayal, and the far-reaching consequences of noble ideas. Above all, John Adams is an enthralling, often surprising story of one of the most important and fascinating Americans who ever lived.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1478144278i/2203.jpg","asin":"0743223136","isbn":"0743223136","isbn13":"9780743223133","publisher":"Simon & Schuster Paperbacks","ratingsCount":350267,"reviewsCount":6932,"numPages":751,"language":"English","rank":685,"year_publication":2001,"list_score":12656,"number_votes":174,"genres_list":"Biography, American History, American Revolution, Politics, Audiobook, Historical, Biography Memoir, Presidents, Nonfiction, History","authors_list":"David McCullough","series_list":"","places_list":"Boston, Massachusetts, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","awards_list":"Pulitzer Prize, Ambassador Book Award, Audie Award, Puddly Award, American Revolution Round Table Award, Fraunces Tavern Museum Book Award","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":true,"Childrens":false,"Classics":false,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":false,"Historical":true,"Historical Fiction":false,"Literature":false,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":true,"Novels":false,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":4.06,"filename":"book1019.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33507.Twenty_Thousand_Leagues_Under_the_Sea","title":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea","titleComplete":"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Captain Nemo, #2)","description":"When an unidentified “monster” threatens international shipping, French oceanographer Pierre Aronnax and his unflappable assistant Conseil join an expedition organized by the US Navy to hunt down and destroy the menace.

Thus begins a journey of 20,000 leagues—nearly 50,000 miles—that will take Captain Nemo, his crew, and these three adventurers on a journey of discovery through undersea forests, coral graveyards, miles-deep trenches, and even the sunken ruins of Atlantis.

Scary and suspenseful, it is a timeless classic in the American canon.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1409596011i/248596.jpg","asin":"0380729407","isbn":"0380729407","isbn13":"9780380729401","publisher":"Harper Voyager","ratingsCount":120862,"reviewsCount":9181,"numPages":293,"language":"English","rank":677,"year_publication":1962,"list_score":12900,"number_votes":178,"genres_list":"Science Fiction Fantasy, Mystery, Halloween, Audiobook, Fiction, Classics, Young Adult, Fantasy, Horror, Science Fiction","authors_list":"Ray Bradbury","series_list":"Green Town","places_list":"Green Town, Illinois","awards_list":"","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":true,"Childrens":false,"Classics":true,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":true,"Fiction":true,"Historical":false,"Historical Fiction":false,"Literature":false,"Magic":false,"Mystery":true,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":false,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":true,"Science Fiction Fantasy":true,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":true,"avgRating":3.92,"filename":"book1027.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16286.The_Magus","title":"The Magus","titleComplete":"The Magus","description":"This daring literary thriller, rich with eroticism and suspense, is one of John Fowles's best-loved and bestselling novels and has contributed significantly to his international reputation as a writer of the first degree.

In another, it is a tragedy, a reflection on the difficulties of writing and the solitary nature of reading. The Reader buys a fashionable new book, which opens with an exhortation: \"Relax. Concentrate. Dispel every other thought. Let the world around you fade.\" Alas, after 30 or so pages, he discovers that his copy is corrupted, and consists of nothing but the first section, over and over. Returning to the bookshop, he discovers the volume, which he thought was by Calvino, is actually by the Polish writer Bazakbal. Given the choice between the two, he goes for the Pole, as does the Other Reader, Ludmilla. But this copy turns out to be by yet another writer, as does the next, and the next.The real Calvino intersperses 10 different pastiches—stories of menace, spies, mystery, premonition—with explorations of how and why we choose to read, make meanings, and get our bearings or fail to. Meanwhile the Reader and Ludmilla try to reach, and read, each other. If on a Winter's Night is dazzling, vertiginous, and deeply romantic. \"What makes lovemaking and reading resemble each other most is that within both of them times and spaces open, different from measurable time and space.\"","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1528312857i/374233.jpg","isbn13":"9780088619451","publisher":"L&OD Key Porter","ratingsCount":89010,"reviewsCount":7819,"numPages":260,"language":"English","rank":672,"year_publication":1979,"list_score":13065,"number_votes":160,"genres_list":"Italian Literature, 20th Century, Fiction, Italy, Classics, Novels, Literary Fiction, Books About Books, Magical Realism, Literature","authors_list":"Italo Calvino, William Weaver","series_list":"","places_list":"","awards_list":"Ars Translationis, Ein Buch für die Stadt","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":false,"Childrens":false,"Classics":true,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":true,"Historical":false,"Historical Fiction":false,"Literature":true,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":true,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":4.04,"filename":"book1032.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7304203-shadowfever","title":"Shadowfever","titleComplete":"Shadowfever (Fever, #5)","description":"“Evil is a completely different creature, Mac.

Unprepared for the consequences of their attraction, at first each feigns indifference. But during the restless summer weeks that follow, unrelenting buried currents of obsession and fear, fascination and desire, intensify their passion as they test the charged ground between them. What grows from the depths of their spirits is a romance of scarcely six weeks' duration and an experience that marks them for a lifetime. For what the two discover on the Riviera and during a sultry evening in Rome is the one thing both already fear they may never truly find again: total intimacy. The psychological maneuvers that accompany attraction have seldom been more shrewdly captured than in André Aciman's frank, unsentimental, heartrending elegy to human passion.

Today there is just one. Us. Homo sapiens. How did our species succeed in the battle for dominance? Why did our foraging ancestors come together to create cities and kingdoms? How did we come to believe in gods, nations and human rights; to trust money, books and laws; and to be enslaved by bureaucracy, timetables and consumerism? And what will our world be like in the millennia to come? In Sapiens, Dr Yuval Noah Harari spans the whole of human history, from the very first humans to walk the earth to the radical – and sometimes devastating – breakthroughs of the Cognitive, Agricultural and Scientific Revolutions. Drawing on insights from biology, anthropology, paleontology and economics, he explores how the currents of history have shaped our human societies, the animals and plants around us, and even our personalities. Have we become happier as history has unfolded? Can we ever free our behaviour from the heritage of our ancestors? And what, if anything, can we do to influence the course of the centuries to come? Bold, wide-ranging and provocative, Sapiens challenges everything we thought we knew about being human: our thoughts, our actions, our power ... and our future.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1595674533i/23692271.jpg","publisher":"Vintage","ratingsCount":871674,"reviewsCount":48072,"numPages":512,"language":"English","rank":664,"year_publication":2011,"list_score":13263,"number_votes":145,"genres_list":"Anthropology, Science, Psychology, Historical, Philosophy, Evolution, Audiobook, Sociology, Nonfiction, History","authors_list":"Yuval Noah Harari","series_list":"","places_list":"","awards_list":"Royal Society of Biology General Book Prize, J.

But his success was a surprise to the racing establishment, which had written off the crooked-legged racehorse with the sad tail. Three men changed Seabiscuit’s fortunes:Charles Howard was a onetime bicycle repairman who introduced the automobile to the western United States and became an overnight millionaire. When he needed a trainer for his new racehorses, he hired Tom Smith, a mysterious mustang breaker from the Colorado plains. Smith urged Howard to buy Seabiscuit for a bargain-basement price, then hired as his jockey Red Pollard, a failed boxer who was blind in one eye, half-crippled, and prone to quoting passages from Ralph Waldo Emerson. Over four years, these unlikely partners survived a phenomenal run of bad fortune, conspiracy, and severe injury to transform Seabiscuit from a neurotic, pathologically indolent also-ran into an American sports icon. Author Laura Hillenbrand brilliantly re-creates a universal underdog story, one that proves life is a horse race.From the Hardcover edition.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1171644213i/110737.jpg","asin":"0345465083","isbn":"0345465083","isbn13":"9780345465085","publisher":"Ballantine Books","ratingsCount":158601,"reviewsCount":4808,"numPages":457,"language":"English","rank":662,"year_publication":1999,"list_score":13310,"number_votes":195,"genres_list":"Biography, Horses, American History, Animals, Historical, Biography Memoir, Sports, Audiobook, Nonfiction, History","authors_list":"Laura Hillenbrand","series_list":"","places_list":"The United States of America","awards_list":"Book Sense Book of the Year Award, William Hill Sports Book of the Year, Puddly Award, National Book Critics Circle Award","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":true,"Childrens":false,"Classics":false,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":false,"Historical":true,"Historical Fiction":false,"Literature":false,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":true,"Novels":false,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":4.22,"filename":"book1041.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18423.The_Left_Hand_of_Darkness","title":"The Left Hand of Darkness","titleComplete":"The Left Hand of Darkness","description":"A groundbreaking work of science fiction, The Left Hand of Darkness tells the story of a lone human emissary to Winter, an alien world whose inhabitants can choose - and change - their gender.

He asks his nurse to take the baby away to an institution and never to reveal the secret. But Caroline, the nurse, cannot leave the infant. Instead, she disappears into another city to raise the child herself.

And still, the real battle lies ahead: they must confront Galbatorix. When they do, they will have to be strong enough to defeat him. And if they cannot, no one can. There will be no second chance.The Rider and his dragon have come further than anyone dared to hope. But can they topple the evil king and restore justice to Alagaësia? And if so, at what cost?This is the spellbinding conclusion to Christopher Paolini's worldwide bestselling Inheritance cycle.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1390886502i/7664041.jpg","asin":"0375856110","isbn":"0375856110","isbn13":"9780375856112","publisher":"Alfred A.

These narrative threads wind sinuously across a vast, richly detailed tapestry of the violent, sensual world of vampirism, taking us back 6,000 years to its beginnings.  As the stories of the \"first brood\" of blood drinkers are revealed, we are swept across the ages, from Egypt to South America to the Himalayas to all the shrouded corners of the globe where vampires have left their mark. Vampires are created--mortals succumbing to the sensation of \"being enptied, of being devoured, of being nothing.\" Vampires are destroyed.  Dark rituals are performed--the rituals of ancient creatures prowling the modern world.  And, finally, we are brought to a moment in the twentieth century when, in an astonishing climax, the fate of the living dead--and perhaps of the living, all the living--will be decided.From the Hardcover edition.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327871992i/43758.jpg","asin":"0345419626","isbn":"0345419626","isbn13":"9780345419620","publisher":"Ballantine Books","ratingsCount":146168,"reviewsCount":2698,"numPages":448,"language":"English","rank":651,"year_publication":1988,"list_score":13689,"number_votes":199,"genres_list":"Science Fiction Fantasy, Adult, Urban Fantasy, Gothic, Paranormal, Fiction, Supernatural, Vampires, Fantasy, Horror","authors_list":"Anne Rice","series_list":"The Vampire Chronicles","places_list":"","awards_list":"Bram Stoker Award, Locus Award","Adult":true,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":false,"Childrens":false,"Classics":false,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":true,"Fiction":true,"Historical":false,"Historical Fiction":false,"Literature":false,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":false,"Paranormal":true,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":true,"Supernatural":true,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":true,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":3.9,"filename":"book1055.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7631105-the-scorch-trials","title":"The Scorch Trials","titleComplete":"The Scorch Trials (The Maze Runner, #2)","description":"Solving the Maze was supposed to be the end.    Thomas was sure that escape from the Maze would mean freedom for him and the Gladers.

Leif Enger's debut, Peace Like a River, is one such work. His richly evocative novel, narrated by an asthmatic 11-year-old named Reuben Land, is the story of Reuben's unusual family and their journey across the frozen Badlands of the Dakotas in search of his fugitive older brother. Charged with the murder of two locals who terrorized their family, Davy has fled, understanding that the scales of justice will not weigh in his favor. But Reuben, his father, Jeremiah—a man of faith so deep he has been known to produce miracles—and Reuben's little sister, Swede, follow closely behind the fleeing Davy.Affecting and dynamic, Peace Like a River is at once a tragedy, a romance, and an unflagging exploration into the spirituality and magic possible in the everyday world, and in that of the world awaiting us on the other side of life. In Enger's superb debut effort, we witness a wondrous celebration of family, faith, and spirit, the likes of which we haven't seen in a long, long time—and the birth of a classic work of literature.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1436139976i/227571.jpg","asin":"B007CV7V5W","isbn":"0802139256","isbn13":"9780802139252","publisher":"Atlantic Monthly Press","ratingsCount":86822,"reviewsCount":8668,"numPages":312,"language":"English","rank":639,"year_publication":2001,"list_score":14155,"number_votes":171,"genres_list":"Historical Fiction, Adult Fiction, Contemporary, Coming Of Age, Fiction, Novels, Literary Fiction, Book Club, Adult, Family","authors_list":"Leif Enger","series_list":"","places_list":"North Dakota, The United States of America","awards_list":"Book Sense Book of the Year Award, Independent Publisher Book Award (IPPY), ALA Alex Award, International Dublin Literary Award","Adult":true,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":false,"Childrens":false,"Classics":false,"Contemporary":true,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":true,"Historical":false,"Historical Fiction":true,"Literature":false,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":true,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":4,"filename":"book1064.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/415.Gravity_s_Rainbow","title":"Gravity's Rainbow","titleComplete":"Gravity's Rainbow","description":"Winner of the 1973 National Book Award, Gravity's Rainbow is a postmodern epic, a work as exhaustively significant to the second half of the 20th century as Joyce's Ulysses was to the first.

Daß dieses im Herbst 1917 vollendete Buch erst im Juni 1919, ein halbes Jahr nach Kriegsende, veröffentlicht wurde, lag an der Unbekanntheit des Verfassers. Denn Hesse hatte das Manuskript dem Verlag als das Erstlingswerk eines kranken jungen Dichters empfohlen, des zeitkritischen Poeten Emil Sinclair, der bisher nur in Zeitungen und Zeitschriften durch pazifistische Mahnrufe und Erzählungen aufgefallen war (die gleichfalls von Hesse stammten). Doch trotz des Inkognitos erlebte das Buch eine geradezu stürmische Aufnahme und wurde noch im Erscheinungsjahr mit dem Fontane-Preis für das beste Erstlingswerk eines Nachwuchsautors ausgezeichnet. Thomas Mann verglich die elektrisierende Wirkung des Buches mit der von Goethes Werther, da es »mit unheimlicher Genauigkeit den Nerv der Zeit traf und eine ganze Jugend, die wähnte aus ihrer Mitte sei ihr ein Künder ihres tiefsten Lebens entstanden, zu dankbarem Entzücken hinriß«. Bis zur Entdeckung des Pseudonyms im Mai 1920 erschienen drei Auflagen, denen dann unter Hesses eigenem Namen zu seinen Lebzeiten noch 93 weitere folgten.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1421510580i/24861.jpg","asin":"3518367064","isbn13":"9783518367063","publisher":"Suhrkamp Verlag","ratingsCount":98420,"reviewsCount":6333,"numPages":193,"language":"German","rank":608,"year_publication":1919,"list_score":15584,"number_votes":192,"genres_list":"German Literature, Germany, Coming Of Age, 20th Century, Fiction, Spirituality, Philosophy, Classics, Novels, Literature","authors_list":"Hermann Hesse, Thomas Mann","series_list":"","places_list":"","awards_list":"","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":false,"Childrens":false,"Classics":true,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":true,"Historical":false,"Historical Fiction":false,"Literature":true,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":true,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":4.14,"filename":"book1094.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/366522.P_S_I_Love_You","title":"P.S.

Professors are asked to consider their demise and to ruminate on what matters most to them: What wisdom would we impart to the world if we knew it was our last chance? If we had to vanish tomorrow, what would we want as our legacy?When Randy Pausch, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon, was asked to give such a lecture, he didn't have to imagine it as his last, since he had recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer. But the lecture he gave, 'Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams', wasn't about dying. It was about the importance of overcoming obstacles, of enabling the dreams of others, of seizing every moment (because time is all you have and you may find one day that you have less than you think). It was a summation of everything Randy had come to believe. It was about living.In this book, Randy Pausch has combined the humour, inspiration, and intelligence that made his lecture such a phenomenon and given it an indelible form. It is a book that will be shared for generations to come.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1529682044i/40611510.jpg","asin":"B00139VU7E","publisher":"Hachette Books","ratingsCount":331863,"reviewsCount":18692,"numPages":217,"language":"English","rank":581,"year_publication":2008,"list_score":16379,"number_votes":205,"genres_list":"Biography, Memoir, Self Help, Autobiography, Philosophy, Inspirational, Audiobook, Nonfiction, Personal Development, Biography Memoir","authors_list":"Jeffrey Zaslow, Randy Pausch","series_list":"","places_list":"","awards_list":"Audie Award","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":true,"Childrens":false,"Classics":false,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":false,"Historical":false,"Historical Fiction":false,"Literature":false,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":true,"Novels":false,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":4.26,"filename":"book1122.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4009.Nine_Stories","title":"Nine Stories","titleComplete":"Nine Stories","description":"Nine Stories (1953) is a collection of short stories by American fiction writer J.

But since its original prewar translation there has been no completely new version in English. Now, Penguin brings Proust's masterpiece to new audiences throughout the world, beginning with Lydia Davis's internationally acclaimed translation of the first volume, Swann's Way.Swann's Way is one of the preeminent novels of childhood: a sensitive boy's impressions of his family and neighbors, all brought dazzlingly back to life years later by the taste of a madeleine. It also enfolds the short novel \"Swann in Love,\" an incomparable study of sexual jealousy that becomes a crucial part of the vast, unfolding structure of In Search of Lost Time. The first volume of the work that established Proust as one of the finest voices of the modern age — satirical, skeptical, confiding, and endlessly varied in its response to the human condition — Swann's Way also stands on its own as a perfect rendering of a life in art, of the past re-created through memory.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1657564911i/12749.jpg","asin":"0142437964","isbn":"0142437964","isbn13":"9780142437964","publisher":"Penguin Classics","ratingsCount":55432,"reviewsCount":4676,"numPages":444,"language":"English","rank":578,"year_publication":1913,"list_score":16425,"number_votes":209,"genres_list":"French Literature, 20th Century, Fiction, Philosophy, Classics, Novels, Unfinished, Literary Fiction, France, Literature","authors_list":"Marcel Proust, Lydia Davis","series_list":"À la recherche du temps perdu","places_list":"Paris, Combray, France","awards_list":"French-American Foundation Translation Prize, Премія «Сковорода»","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":false,"Childrens":false,"Classics":true,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":true,"Historical":false,"Historical Fiction":false,"Literature":true,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":true,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":4.14,"filename":"book1126.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77566.Hyperion","title":"Hyperion","titleComplete":"Hyperion (Hyperion Cantos, #1)","description":"On the world called Hyperion, beyond the law of the Hegemony of Man, there waits the creature called the Shrike.

Everest in the early afternoon of May 10, 1996, he hadn't slept in fifty-seven hours and was reeling from the brain-altering effects of oxygen depletion. As he turned to begin his long, dangerous descent from 29,028 feet, twenty other climbers were still pushing doggedly toward the top. No one had noticed that the sky had begun to fill with clouds. Six hours later and 3,000 feet lower, in 70-knot winds and blinding snow, Krakauer collapsed in his tent, freezing, hallucinating from exhaustion and hypoxia, but safe. The following morning, he learned that six of his fellow climbers hadn't made it back to their camp and were desperately struggling for their lives. When the storm finally passed, five of them would be dead, and the sixth so horribly frostbitten that his right hand would have to be amputated.Into Thin Air is the definitive account of the deadliest season in the history of Everest by the acclaimed journalist and author of the bestseller Into the Wild. On assignment for Outside Magazine to report on the growing commercialization of the mountain, Krakauer, an accomplished climber, went to the Himalayas as a client of Rob Hall, the most respected high-altitude guide in the world. A rangy, thirty-five-year-old New Zealander, Hall had summited Everest four times between 1990 and 1995 and had led thirty-nine climbers to the top. Ascending the mountain in close proximity to Hall's team was a guided expedition led by Scott Fischer, a forty-year-old American with legendary strength and drive who had climbed the peak without supplemental oxygen in 1994. But neither Hall nor Fischer survived the rogue storm that struck in May 1996.Krakauer examines what it is about Everest that has compelled so many people -- including himself -- to throw caution to the wind, ignore the concerns of loved ones, and willingly subject themselves to such risk, hardship, and expense. Written with emotional clarity and supported by his unimpeachable reporting, Krakauer's eyewitness account of what happened on the roof of the world is a singular achievement.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1631501298i/1898.jpg","publisher":"Anchor Books","ratingsCount":467788,"reviewsCount":16719,"numPages":368,"language":"English","rank":563,"year_publication":1997,"list_score":17078,"number_votes":241,"genres_list":"Biography, Memoir, History, Mountaineering, Biography Memoir, Survival, Sports, Nonfiction, Adventure, Travel","authors_list":"Jon Krakauer","series_list":"","places_list":"Mount Everest, Nepal","awards_list":"Pulitzer Prize, ALA Alex Award, National Book Critics Circle Award, Boardman Tasker Prize","Adult":false,"Adventure":true,"Audiobook":false,"Childrens":false,"Classics":false,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":false,"Historical":false,"Historical Fiction":false,"Literature":false,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":true,"Novels":false,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":4.22,"filename":"book1136.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14935.Sense_and_Sensibility","title":"Sense and Sensibility","titleComplete":"Sense and Sensibility","description":"Alternate cover edition of ISBN 9780141439662'The more I know of the world, the more am I convinced that I shall never see a man whom I can really love.

Using the pseudonym of \"Dr. Seuss\" (Seuss was Geisel's middle name) and only two hundred twenty-three words, Geisel created a replacement for those dull primers: \"The Cat in the Hat.\" The instant success of the book prompted Geisel and his wife to found Beginner Books, and Geisel wrote many popular books in this series, including \"Hop on Pop,\" \"Fox in Socks,\" and \"Green Eggs and Ham.\" Other favorite titles in this series are \"Go, Dog, Go!\" and \"Are You My Mother?\" by P.

And she's introduced with a vengeance, when Clary's mother disappears and Clary herself is almost killed by a grotesque monster sent by the evil and powerful Shadowhunter, Valentine. How could a mere human survive such an attack. In the second novel, City of Ashes, Clary just wants her life to go back to normal--but that turns out to be impossible. For one thing, her mother is still in the hospital, in a mysterious coma. For another, she and her newfound brother Jace have fallen under a cloud of suspicion now that the Shadowhunter world knows that Valentine is still alive--and that Jace and Clary are his son and daughter. Then Clary's best friend Simon is turned into a vampire and kidnapped by Valentine, who intends to sacrifice him as part of a bloody ritual that will make the Mortal Instruments Valentine's forever. In book three, City of Glass, Clary has to use all her ingenuity and newfound magical skills to get herself to the Glass City in Idris, the secretive Shadowhunters' home country, where she is forbidden to go--for it is only there that she can find the cure to the enchanted sleeping sickness to which her mother has succumbed. When Valentine attacks the city and destroys the demon towers, Clary and her allies are all that stand between him and the total annihilation of all Shadowhunters. Love is a mortal sin and the past tangles inextricably with the present as Clary and Jace face down their father in the final installment of the Mortal Instruments series.

Kya Clark is barefoot and wild; unfit for polite society. So in late 1969, when the popular Chase Andrews is found dead, locals immediately suspect her.But Kya is not what they say. A born naturalist with just one day of school, she takes life's lessons from the land, learning the real ways of the world from the dishonest signals of fireflies. But while she has the skills to live in solitude forever, the time comes when she yearns to be touched and loved. Drawn to two young men from town, who are each intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new and startling world—until the unthinkable happens.In Where the Crawdads Sing, Owens juxtaposes an exquisite ode to the natural world against a profound coming of age story and haunting mystery. Thought-provoking, wise, and deeply moving, Owens’s debut novel reminds us that we are forever shaped by the child within us, while also subject to the beautiful and violent secrets that nature keeps.The story asks how isolation influences the behavior of a young woman, who like all of us, has the genetic propensity to belong to a group. The clues to the mystery are brushed into the lush habitat and natural histories of its wild creatures.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1582135294i/36809135.jpg","isbn":"0735219117","isbn13":"9780735219113","publisher":"G.P.

Alan Paton’s impassioned novel about a black man’s country under white man’s law is a work of searing beauty.Cry, the beloved country, for the unborn child that is the inheritor of our fear. Let him not love the earth too deeply. Let him not laugh too gladly when the water runs through his fingers, nor stand too silent when the setting sun makes red the veld with fire. Let him not be too moved when the birds of his land are singing, nor give too much of his heart to a mountain or valley. For fear will rob him of all if he gives too much.The eminent literary critic Lewis Gannett wrote, “We have had many novels from statesmen and reformers, almost all bad; many novels from poets, almost all thin. In Alan Paton’s Cry, the Beloved Country the statesman, the poet and the novelist meet in a unique harmony.” Cry, the Beloved Country is the deeply moving story of the Zulu pastor Stephen Kumalo and his son, Absalom, set against the background of a land and a people riven by racial injustice. Remarkable for its lyricism, unforgettable for character and incident, Cry, the Beloved Country is a classic work of love and hope, courage and endurance, born of the dignity of man.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1344182368i/6150.jpg","asin":"074326195X","isbn":"074326195X","isbn13":"9780743261951","publisher":"Scribner","ratingsCount":71943,"reviewsCount":4543,"numPages":316,"language":"English","rank":541,"year_publication":1948,"list_score":18002,"number_votes":248,"genres_list":"Historical Fiction, School, Read For School, Historical, Fiction, Africa, Classics, Novels, South Africa, Literature","authors_list":"Alan Paton","series_list":"","places_list":"South Africa","awards_list":"Anisfield-Wolf Book Award","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":false,"Childrens":false,"Classics":true,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":true,"Historical":true,"Historical Fiction":true,"Literature":true,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":true,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":3.91,"filename":"book1161.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/70535.2001","title":"2001: A Space Odyssey","titleComplete":"2001: A Space Odyssey","description":"On the Moon, an enigma is uncovered.So great are the implications of this discovery that for the first time men are sent out deep into our solar system.But long before their destination is reached, things begin to go horribly, inexplicably wrong...One of the greatest-selling science fiction novels of our time, this classic book will grip you to the very end.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1432468943i/70535.jpg","publisher":"Roc","ratingsCount":295800,"reviewsCount":7585,"numPages":297,"language":"English","rank":540,"year_publication":1968,"list_score":18020,"number_votes":245,"genres_list":"Science Fiction Fantasy, Space, Audiobook, Fiction, Classics, Novels, Speculative Fiction, Fantasy, Science Fiction, Literature","authors_list":"Arthur C.

And in New Orleans, on Christmas Eve, this strangest of family sagas is brought to its startling climax.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327289387i/11901.jpg","asin":"0099471426","isbn":"0099471426","isbn13":"9780099471424","publisher":"Arrow","ratingsCount":111260,"reviewsCount":4425,"numPages":1207,"language":"English","rank":534,"year_publication":1990,"list_score":18279,"number_votes":246,"genres_list":"Historical Fiction, Gothic, Urban Fantasy, Paranormal, Fiction, Witches, Magic, Supernatural, Fantasy, Horror","authors_list":"Anne Rice","series_list":"Lives of the Mayfair Witches","places_list":"Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana, Scotland Yard, London, England","awards_list":"Locus Award","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":false,"Childrens":false,"Classics":false,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":true,"Fiction":true,"Historical":false,"Historical Fiction":true,"Literature":false,"Magic":true,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":false,"Paranormal":true,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":true,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":true,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":4.11,"filename":"book1168.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40651883-snow-crash","title":"Snow Crash","titleComplete":"Snow Crash","description":"In reality, Hiro Protagonist delivers pizza for Uncle Enzo's CosoNostra Pizza Inc., but in the Metaverse he's a warrior prince.

Deep in the stacks of Oxford's Bodleian Library, young scholar Diana Bishop unwittingly calls up a bewitched alchemical manuscript in the course of her research. Descended from an old and distinguished line of witches, Diana wants nothing to do with sorcery; so after a furtive glance and a few notes, she banishes the book to the stacks. But her discovery sets a fantastical underworld stirring, and a horde of daemons, witches, and vampires soon descends upon the library. Diana has stumbled upon a coveted treasure lost for centuries-and she is the only creature who can break its spell. Debut novelist Deborah Harkness has crafted a mesmerizing and addictive read, equal parts history and magic, romance and suspense. Diana is a bold heroine who meets her equal in vampire geneticist Matthew Clairmont, and gradually warms up to him as their alliance deepens into an intimacy that violates age-old taboos. This smart, sophisticated story harks back to the novels of Anne Rice, but it is as contemporary and sensual as the Twilight series-with an extra serving of historical realism.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1525097370i/8667848.jpg","isbn":"0670022411","isbn13":"9780670022410","publisher":"Viking Penguin","ratingsCount":455171,"reviewsCount":42324,"numPages":579,"language":"English","rank":530,"year_publication":2011,"list_score":18503,"number_votes":219,"genres_list":"Paranormal Romance, Urban Fantasy, Paranormal, Fiction, Witches, Magic, Supernatural, Vampires, Fantasy, Romance","authors_list":"Deborah Harkness","series_list":"The All Souls Trilogy ","places_list":"Madison, New York, Oxford, Oxfordshire, England, Saint Lucien","awards_list":"SCIBA Award, Goodreads Choice Award","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":false,"Childrens":false,"Classics":false,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":true,"Fiction":true,"Historical":false,"Historical Fiction":false,"Literature":false,"Magic":true,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":false,"Paranormal":true,"Romance":true,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":true,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":true,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":4.02,"filename":"book1172.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8709527-bloodlines","title":"Bloodlines","titleComplete":"Bloodlines (Bloodlines, #1)","description":"I wasn't free of my past, not yet.Sydney's blood is special.

Max Brooks, driven by the urgency of preserving the acid-etched first-hand experiences of the survivors from those apocalyptic years, traveled across the United States of America and throughout the world, from decimated cities that once teemed with upwards of thirty million souls to the most remote and inhospitable areas of the planet. He recorded the testimony of men, women, and sometimes children who came face-to-face with the living, or at least the undead, hell of that dreadful time. World War Z is the result. Never before have we had access to a document that so powerfully conveys the depth of fear and horror, and also the ineradicable spirit of resistance, that gripped human society through the plague years.Ranging from the now infamous village of New Dachang in the United Federation of China, where the epidemiological trail began with the twelve-year-old Patient Zero, to the unnamed northern forests where untold numbers sought a terrible and temporary refuge in the cold, to the United States of Southern Africa, where the Redeker Plan provided hope for humanity at an unspeakable price, to the west-of-the-Rockies redoubt where the North American tide finally started to turn, this invaluable chronicle reflects the full scope and duration of the Zombie War.Most of all, the book captures with haunting immediacy the human dimension of this epochal event. Facing the often raw and vivid nature of these personal accounts requires a degree of courage on the part of the reader, but the effort is invaluable because, as Mr. Brooks says in his introduction, \"By excluding the human factor, aren't we risking the kind of personal detachment from history that may, heaven forbid, lead us one day to repeat it? And in the end, isn't the human factor the only true difference between us and the enemy we now refer to as 'the living dead'?\"Note: Some of the numerical and factual material contained in this edition was previously published under the auspices of the United Nations Postwar Commission.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1528312647i/8908.jpg","asin":"0307346609","isbn":"0307346609","isbn13":"9780307346605","publisher":"Crown","ratingsCount":496843,"reviewsCount":28217,"numPages":342,"language":"English","rank":522,"year_publication":2006,"list_score":18772,"number_votes":240,"genres_list":"Audiobook, Apocalyptic, War, Fiction, Post Apocalyptic, Fantasy, Horror, Science Fiction, Zombies, Dystopia","authors_list":"Max Brooks","series_list":"World War Z","places_list":"","awards_list":"Audie Award, Premio Ignotus, Lincoln Award, Seiun Award 星雲賞","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":true,"Childrens":false,"Classics":false,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":true,"Fiction":true,"Historical":false,"Historical Fiction":false,"Literature":false,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":false,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":true,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":4.02,"filename":"book1180.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8909.The_War_of_the_Worlds","title":"The War of the Worlds","titleComplete":"The War of the Worlds","description":"When an army of invading Martians lands in England, panic and terror seize the population.

He eviscerates the major arguments for religion, and demonstrates the supreme improbability of a supreme being. He shows how religion fuels war, foments bigotry, and abuses children, buttressing his points with historical and contemporary evidence.The God Delusion makes a compelling case that belief in God is not just wrong, but potentially deadly. It also offers exhilarating insight into the advantages of atheism to the individual and society, not the least of which is a clearer, truer appreciation of the universe's wonders than any faith could ever muster.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347220693i/14743.jpg","asin":"0618680004","isbn":"0618680004","isbn13":"9780618680009","publisher":"Houghton Mifflin Co.","ratingsCount":258083,"reviewsCount":9139,"numPages":374,"language":"English","rank":517,"year_publication":2006,"list_score":19078,"number_votes":242,"genres_list":"Science, Psychology, Spirituality, Philosophy, Evolution, Theology, Religion, Audiobook, Nonfiction, Atheism","authors_list":"Richard Dawkins","series_list":"","places_list":"","awards_list":"British Book Award","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":true,"Childrens":false,"Classics":false,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":false,"Historical":false,"Historical Fiction":false,"Literature":false,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":true,"Novels":false,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":3.9,"filename":"book1185.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9293020-the-elephant-tree","title":"The Elephant Tree","titleComplete":"The Elephant Tree","description":"Mark Fallon is an overworked detective investigating a spate of attacks at a string of high profile city centre nightclubs.

In the course of the ensuing trial, it becomes clear that what is at stake is more than a man's guilt. For on San Pedro, memories of a charmed love affair between a white boy and the Japanese girl who grew up to become Kabuo's wife; memories of land desired, paid for, and lost.

She began it soon after she had finished Emma, completing it in August 1816. She died, aged 41, in 1817; Persuasion was published in December that year (but dated 1818). Persuasion is linked to Northanger Abbey not only by the fact that the two books were originally bound up in one volume and published together, but also because both stories are set partly in Bath, a fashionable city with which Austen was well acquainted, having lived there from 1801 to 1805. Besides the theme of persuasion, the novel evokes other topics, such as the Royal Navy, in which two of Jane Austen's brothers ultimately rose to the rank of admiral. As in Northanger Abbey, the superficial social life of Bath-well known to Austen, who spent several relatively unhappy and unproductive years there-is portrayed extensively and serves as a setting for the second half of the book. In many respects Persuasion marks a break with Austen's previous works, both in the more biting, even irritable satire directed at some of the novel's characters and in the regretful, resigned outlook of its otherwise admirable heroine, Anne Elliot, in the first part of the story. Against this is set the energy and appeal of the Royal Navy, which symbolises for Anne and the reader the possibility of a more outgoing, engaged, and fulfilling life, and it is this worldview which triumphs for the most part at the end of the novel.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1385172413i/2156.jpg","asin":"0192802631","isbn":"0192802631","isbn13":"9780192802637","publisher":"Oxford University Press","ratingsCount":641104,"reviewsCount":28009,"numPages":249,"language":"English","rank":496,"year_publication":1817,"list_score":21429,"number_votes":273,"genres_list":"Historical Fiction, 19th Century, Historical, Fiction, Classic Literature, Classics, Historical Romance, Audiobook, Romance, Literature","authors_list":"Richard Fadem, Jane Austen, Джейн Остин, Deidre Shauna Lynch, James Kinsley","series_list":"","places_list":"Bath, Somerset, England, England, Somerset, England, Lyme Regis, England","awards_list":"","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":true,"Childrens":false,"Classics":true,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":true,"Historical":true,"Historical Fiction":true,"Literature":true,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":false,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":true,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":4.15,"filename":"book1205.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/137791.Divine_Secrets_of_the_Ya_Ya_Sisterhood","title":"Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood","titleComplete":"Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood","description":"When Siddalee Walker, oldest daughter of Vivi Abbott Walker, Ya-Ya extraordinaire, is interviewed in the New York Times about a hit play she's directed, her mother gets described as a \"tap-dancing child abuser.\" Enraged, Vivi disowns Sidda.

I, ROBOT They mustn't harm a human being, they must obey hitman orders, and they must protect their own existence...but only so long as that doesn't violate rules one and two.

It was a bold new era of evolution that would open up enormous possibilities—and unforeseen risks. For the scientists who invented the earliest robots weren't content that their creations should ' remain programmed helpers, companions, and semisentient worker-machines. And soon the robots themselves; aware of their own intelligence, power, and humanity, aren't either. As humans and robots struggle to survive together—and sometimes against each other—on earth and in space, the future of both hangs in the balance.

And both are asking the same questions: What is human? And is humanity obsolete?

Langdon recognizes the object as an ancient invitation...one meant to usher its recipient into a long-lost world of esoteric wisdom.When Langdon's beloved mentor, Peter Solomon - a prominent Mason and philanthropist - is brutally kidnapped, Langdon realizes his only hope of saving Peter is to accept this mystical invitation and follow wherever it leads him.

In nineteen minutes, you can bake scones or get a tooth filled by a dentist; you can fold laundry for a family of five....In nineteen minutes, you can stop the world, or you can just jump off it. In nineteen minutes, you can get revenge. Sterling is a small, ordinary New Hampshire town where nothing ever happens -- until the day its complacency is shattered by a shocking act of violence. In the aftermath, the town's residents must not only seek justice in order to begin healing but also come to terms with the role they played in the tragedy. For them, the lines between truth and fiction, right and wrong, insider and outsider have been obscured forever. Josie Cormier, the teenage daughter of the judge sitting on the case, could be the state's best witness, but she can't remember what happened in front of her own eyes. And as the trial progresses, fault lines between the high school and the adult community begin to show, destroying the closest of friendships and families. Nineteen Minutes is New York Times bestselling author Jodi Picoult's most raw, honest, and important novel yet. Told with the straightforward style for which she has become known, it asks simple questions that have no easy answers: Can your own child become a mystery to you?

The Creeds are going to learn that sometimes dead is better.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1480069533i/33124137.jpg","publisher":"Scribner","ratingsCount":531905,"reviewsCount":20423,"numPages":580,"language":"English","rank":479,"year_publication":1983,"list_score":22894,"number_votes":307,"genres_list":"Adult, Mystery, Audiobook, Paranormal, Fiction, Thriller, Suspense, Supernatural, Fantasy, Horror","authors_list":"Stephen King","series_list":"","places_list":"Ludlow, Maine, Maine","awards_list":"Locus Award, World Fantasy Award","Adult":true,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":true,"Childrens":false,"Classics":false,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":true,"Fiction":true,"Historical":false,"Historical Fiction":false,"Literature":false,"Magic":false,"Mystery":true,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":false,"Paranormal":true,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":true,"Thriller":true,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":4.04,"filename":"book1226.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18460392-all-the-bright-places","title":"All the Bright Places","titleComplete":"All the Bright Places","description":"The Fault in Our Stars meets Eleanor and Park in this exhilarating and heart-wrenching love story about a girl who learns to live from a boy who intends to die.Soon to be a major motion picture starring Elle Fanning! Theodore Finch is fascinated by death, and he constantly thinks of ways he might kill himself.

While spending a few weeks in Bath with a family friend, Catherine meets and falls in love with Henry Tilney, who invites her to visit his family estate, Northanger Abbey. Once there, Catherine, a great reader of Gothic thrillers, lets the shadowy atmosphere of the old mansion fill her mind with terrible suspicions. What is the mystery surrounding the death of Henry's mother? Is the family concealing a terrible secret within the elegant rooms of the Abbey? Can she trust Henry, or is he part of an evil conspiracy? Catherine finds dreadful portents in the most prosaic events, until Henry persuades her to see the peril in confusing life with art.Executed with high-spirited gusto, Northanger Abbey is a lighthearted, yet unsentimental commentary on love and marriage.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388201718i/50398.jpg","asin":"1593082649","isbn":"1593082649","isbn13":"9781593082642","publisher":"Barnes & Noble Classics","ratingsCount":366613,"reviewsCount":17916,"numPages":260,"language":"English","rank":475,"year_publication":1817,"list_score":23698,"number_votes":346,"genres_list":"Historical Fiction, 19th Century, Gothic, Historical, Fiction, Classics, Audiobook, Romance, British Literature, Literature","authors_list":"Jane Austen, Alfred Mac Adam","series_list":"","places_list":"Bath, Somerset, England, England, Somerset, England, Gloucestershire, England","awards_list":"","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":true,"Childrens":false,"Classics":true,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":true,"Historical":true,"Historical Fiction":true,"Literature":true,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":false,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":true,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":3.84,"filename":"book1228.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/397483.The_Devil_in_the_White_City","title":"The Devil in the White City: Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair That Changed America","titleComplete":"The Devil in the White City: Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair That Changed America","description":"Author Erik Larson imbues the incredible events surrounding the 1893 Chicago World's Fair with such drama that readers may find themselves checking the book's categorization to be sure that 'The Devil in the White City' is not, in fact, a highly imaginative novel. Larson tells the stories of two men: Daniel H. Burnham, the architect responsible for the fair's construction, and H.H. Holmes, a serial killer masquerading as a charming doctor. Burnham's challenge was immense. In a short period of time, he was forced to overcome the death of his partner and numerous other obstacles to construct the famous \"White City\" around which the fair was built. His efforts to complete the project, and the fair's incredible success, are skillfully related along with entertaining appearances by such notables as Buffalo Bill Cody, Susan B. Anthony, and Thomas Edison. The activities of the sinister Dr. Holmes, who is believed to be responsible for scores of murders around the time of the fair, are equally remarkable. He devised and erected the World's Fair Hotel, complete with crematorium and gas chamber, near the fairgrounds and used the event as well as his own charismatic personality to lure victims. Combining the stories of an architect and a killer in one book, mostly in alternating chapters, seems like an odd choice but it works. The magical appeal and horrifying dark side of 19th-century Chicago are both revealed through Larson's skillful writing. - John Moe","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1583433024i/397483.jpg","asin":"0609608444","isbn":"0609608444","isbn13":"9780609608449","publisher":"Crown Publishers","ratingsCount":631041,"reviewsCount":37600,"numPages":447,"language":"English","rank":473,"year_publication":2003,"list_score":23882,"number_votes":312,"genres_list":"Biography, Mystery, American History, Book Club, Crime, Historical, True Crime, Audiobook, Nonfiction, History","authors_list":"Erik Larson","series_list":"","places_list":"Illinois, Chicago, Illinois","awards_list":"International Horror Guild Award, Book Sense Book of the Year Award, Great Lakes Book Award, Edgar Award, Washington State Book Award, Pacific Northwest Booksellers Association Award, National Book Award Finalist, ALCS Dagger for Non-fiction","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":true,"Childrens":false,"Classics":false,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":false,"Historical":true,"Historical Fiction":false,"Literature":false,"Magic":false,"Mystery":true,"Nonfiction":true,"Novels":false,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":4,"filename":"book1229.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33600.Shantaram","title":"Shantaram","titleComplete":"Shantaram","description":"\"It took me a long time and most of the world to learn what I know about love and fate and the choices we make, but the heart of it came to me in an instant, while I was chained to a wall and being tortured.\"So begins this epic, mesmerizing first novel set in the underworld of contemporary Bombay. Shantaram is narrated by Lin, an escaped convict with a false passport who flees maximum security prison in Australia for the teeming streets of a city where he can disappear.Accompanied by his guide and faithful friend, Prabaker, the two enter Bombay's hidden society of beggars and gangsters, prostitutes and holy men, soldiers and actors, and Indians and exiles from other countries, who seek in this remarkable place what they cannot find elsewhere.As a hunted man without a home, family, or identity, Lin searches for love and meaning while running a clinic in one of the city's poorest slums, and serving his apprenticeship in the dark arts of the Bombay mafia. The search leads him to war, prison torture, murder, and a series of enigmatic and bloody betrayals. The keys to unlock the mysteries and intrigues that bind Lin are held by two people.

Maya Angelou’s debut memoir is a modern American classic beloved worldwide.

Years later, in San Francisco, Maya learns that love for herself, the kindness of others, her own strong spirit, and the ideas of great authors (“I met and fell in love with William Shakespeare”) will allow her to be free instead of imprisoned.

Once caught in its pages, there's no escaping Longfellow's terrible tale. Weeks ago, she was one of Hollywood's biggest writers, wed to one of its greatest stars. The doting mother of their golden child. But now? She's alone, tortured by a horrifying secret no woman could bear. Pursued by those she can't outrun, anguished by a guilt she can't endure, and driven close to madness, she flees to the one place she's ever called home: a small town in Vermont where River House still stands. To a child, the splendid hotel was mysterious and magical and all its glamorous guests knew delicious secrets. Cocooned in its walls, she will write one last book. Her atonement? Or her suicide note?

Then, on the ocean surface, a face appeared. It was that of a young lieutenant, the plane's bombardier, who was struggling to a life raft and pulling himself aboard. So began one of the most extraordinary odysseys of the Second World War.The lieutenant’s name was Louis Zamperini. In boyhood, he'd been a cunning and incorrigible delinquent, breaking into houses, brawling, and fleeing his home to ride the rails. As a teenager, he had channeled his defiance into running, discovering a prodigious talent that had carried him to the Berlin Olympics and within sight of the four-minute mile. But when war had come, the athlete had become an airman, embarking on a journey that led to his doomed flight, a tiny raft, and a drift into the unknown.Ahead of Zamperini lay thousands of miles of open ocean, leaping sharks, a foundering raft, thirst and starvation, enemy aircraft, and, beyond, a trial even greater. Driven to the limits of endurance, Zamperini would answer desperation with ingenuity; suffering with hope, resolve, and humor; brutality with rebellion. His fate, whether triumph or tragedy, would be suspended on the fraying wire of his will.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327861115i/8664353.jpg","asin":"1400064163","isbn":"1400064163","isbn13":"9781400064168","publisher":"Random House","ratingsCount":888667,"reviewsCount":48854,"numPages":475,"language":"English","rank":446,"year_publication":2010,"list_score":26161,"number_votes":315,"genres_list":"Biography, Memoir, War, Historical, Biography Memoir, Military Fiction, Audiobook, Nonfiction, History, World War II","authors_list":"Laura Hillenbrand","series_list":"","places_list":"","awards_list":"Los Angeles Times Book Prize, Pennsylvania Young Readers' Choice Award, Indies Choice Book Award, Dayton Literary Peace Prize, Lincoln Award, Andrew Carnegie Medal, Goodreads Choice Award","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":true,"Childrens":false,"Classics":false,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":false,"Historical":true,"Historical Fiction":false,"Literature":false,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":true,"Novels":false,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":4.37,"filename":"book1255.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3975774-evermore","title":"Evermore","titleComplete":"Evermore (The Immortals, #1)","description":"The first book in Alyson Noël's extraordinary new Immortals series.

If a Prince is not given to vices that make him hated, it is unsusal for his subjects to show their affection for him. 3.

This portrait of a beguiling Southern city was a best-seller (though a flop as a movie). ~ Shots rang out in Savannah's grandest mansion in the misty, early morning hours of May 2, 1981. Was it murder or self-defense? For nearly a decade, the shooting and its aftermath reverberated throughout this city of moss-hung oaks and shaded squares. John Berendt's narrative reads like a thoroughly engrossing novel, and yet it is a work of nonfiction. Berendt interweaves a first-person account of life in this isolated remnant of the Old South with the unpredictable twists and turns of a landmark murder case.The story is peopled by a gallery of remarkable characters: the well-bred society ladies of the Married Woman's Card Club; the turbulent young redneck gigolo; the hapless recluse who owns a bottle of poison so powerful it could kill every man, woman, and child in Savannah; the aging and profane Southern belle who is the \"soul of pampered self-absorption\"; the uproarious black drag queen; the acerbic and arrogant antiques dealer; the sweet-talking, piano-playing con artist; young blacks dancing the minuet at the black debutante ball; and Minerva, the voodoo priestess who works her magic in the graveyard at midnight. These and other Savannahians act as a Greek chorus, with Berendt revealing the alliances, hostilities, and intrigues that thrive in a town where everyone knows everyone else.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1427166915i/386187.jpg","asin":"0679751521","isbn":"0679751521","isbn13":"9780679751526","publisher":"Vintage","ratingsCount":254372,"reviewsCount":10948,"numPages":386,"language":"English","rank":435,"year_publication":1994,"list_score":27605,"number_votes":389,"genres_list":"Mystery, Memoir, Crime, Southern, Classics, True Crime, Audiobook, Nonfiction, History, Travel","authors_list":"John Berendt","series_list":"","places_list":"Savannah, Georgia","awards_list":"Pulitzer Prize, Exclusive Books Boeke Prize, Ferro-Grumley Award, Lambda Literary Award","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":true,"Childrens":false,"Classics":true,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":false,"Historical":false,"Historical Fiction":false,"Literature":false,"Magic":false,"Mystery":true,"Nonfiction":true,"Novels":false,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":3.92,"filename":"book1266.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22463.The_Origin_of_Species","title":"The Origin of Species","titleComplete":"The Origin of Species","description":"Darwin's theory of natural selection issued a profound challenge to orthodox thought and belief: no being or species has been specifically created; all are locked into a pitiless struggle for existence, with extinction looming for those not fitted for the task.

So when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily’s life suddenly seems almost too good to be true.Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He’s also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn’t hurt. Lily can’t get him out of her head. But Ryle’s complete aversion to relationships is disturbing.

It tells the story from the point of view of a narrator of a plague sweeping the French Algerian city of Oran. The narrator remains unknown until the start of the last chapter, chapter 5 of part 5. The novel presents a snapshot of life in Oran as seen through the author's distinctive absurdist point of view.The book tells a gripping tale of human unrelieved horror, of survival and resilience, and of the ways in which humankind confronts death, The Plague is at once a masterfully crafted novel, eloquently understated and epic in scope, and a parable of ageless moral resonance, profoundly relevant to our times. In Oran, a coastal town in North Africa, the plague begins as a series of portents, unheeded by the people. It gradually becomes an omnipresent reality, obliterating all traces of the past and driving its victims to almost unearthly extremes of suffering, madness, and compassion.The Plague is considered an existentialist classic despite Camus' objection to the label. The novel stresses the powerlessness of the individual characters to affect their destinies. The narrative tone is similar to Kafka's, especially in The Trial, whose individual sentences potentially have multiple meanings; the material often pointedly resonating as stark allegory of phenomenal consciousness and the human condition.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1503362434i/11989.jpg","publisher":"Vintage International","ratingsCount":231615,"reviewsCount":12694,"numPages":308,"language":"English","rank":424,"year_publication":1947,"list_score":28779,"number_votes":390,"genres_list":"School, French Literature, 20th Century, Fiction, Philosophy, Classics, Novels, Literary Fiction, France, Literature","authors_list":"Albert Camus, Stuart Gilbert","series_list":"","places_list":"Algeria, Oran, North Africa","awards_list":"Prix des Critiques","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":false,"Childrens":false,"Classics":true,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":true,"Historical":false,"Historical Fiction":false,"Literature":true,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":true,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":4.02,"filename":"book1277.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12127810-the-house-of-hades","title":"The House of Hades","titleComplete":"The House of Hades (The Heroes of Olympus, #4)","description":"Hazel stands at a crossroads.

Surviving an attempt on her life wasn't pleasant, but at least she got a guardian angel out of it. A mysterious, magnetic, gorgeous guardian angel. But despite his role in her life, Patch has been acting anything but angelic. He's more elusive than ever (if that's possible) and what's worse, he seems to be spending time with Nora's archenemy, Marcie Millar.Nora would have hardly noticed Scott Parnell, an old family friend who has moved back to town, if Patch hadn't been acting so distant. Even with Scott's totally infuriating attitude, Nora finds herself drawn to him - despite her lingering feelings that he is hiding something.If that weren't enough, Nora is haunted by images of her murdered father, and comes to question whether her Nephilim bloodline has anything to do with his death. Desperate to figure out what happened, she puts herself in increasingly dangerous situations to get the answer. But maybe some things are better left buried, because the truth could destroy everything - and everyone - she trusts.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1362408146i/7791997.jpg","asin":"1416989439","isbn":"1416989439","isbn13":"9781416989431","publisher":"Simon & Schuster","ratingsCount":310769,"reviewsCount":12261,"numPages":427,"language":"English","rank":422,"year_publication":2010,"list_score":29062,"number_votes":359,"genres_list":"Paranormal Romance, Urban Fantasy, Paranormal, Fiction, Angels, Young Adult Fantasy, Supernatural, Young Adult, Fantasy, Romance","authors_list":"Becca Fitzpatrick","series_list":"Hush, Hush","places_list":"Coldwater, Maine","awards_list":"Goodreads Choice Award","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":false,"Childrens":false,"Classics":false,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":true,"Fiction":true,"Historical":false,"Historical Fiction":false,"Literature":false,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":false,"Paranormal":true,"Romance":true,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":true,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":true,"Young Adult":true,"avgRating":3.99,"filename":"book1279.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18114322-the-grapes-of-wrath","title":"The Grapes of Wrath","titleComplete":"The Grapes of Wrath","description":"The Pulitzer Prize-winning epic of the Great Depression, a book that galvanized—and sometimes outraged—millions of readers.First published in 1939, Steinbeck’s Pulitzer Prize-winning epic of the Great Depression chronicles the Dust Bowl migration of the 1930s and tells the story of one Oklahoma farm family, the Joads—driven from their homestead and forced to travel west to the promised land of California. Out of their trials and their repeated collisions against the hard realities of an America divided into Haves and Have-Nots evolves a drama that is intensely human yet majestic in its scale and moral vision, elemental yet plainspoken, tragic but ultimately stirring in its human dignity. A portrait of the conflict between the powerful and the powerless, of one man’s fierce reaction to injustice, and of one woman’s stoical strength, the novel captures the horrors of the Great Depression and probes into the very nature of equality and justice in America. At once a naturalistic epic, captivity narrative, road novel, and transcendental gospel, Steinbeck’s powerful landmark novel is perhaps the most American of American Classics.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1375670575i/18114322.jpg","asin":"067001690X","isbn":"067001690X","isbn13":"9780670016907","publisher":"Viking","ratingsCount":854777,"reviewsCount":21337,"numPages":479,"language":"English","rank":420,"year_publication":1939,"list_score":29261,"number_votes":388,"genres_list":"Historical Fiction, School, American, Historical, Fiction, Classic Literature, High School, Classics, Novels, Literature","authors_list":"John Steinbeck","series_list":"","places_list":"Oklahoma, California, The United States of America","awards_list":"Pulitzer Prize, National Book Award, California Book Award, Audie Award","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":false,"Childrens":false,"Classics":true,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":true,"Historical":true,"Historical Fiction":true,"Literature":true,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":true,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":4,"filename":"book1280.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8755785-city-of-heavenly-fire","title":"City of Heavenly Fire","titleComplete":"City of Heavenly Fire (The Mortal Instruments, #6)","description":"In this dazzling and long-awaited conclusion to the acclaimed Mortal Instruments series, Clary and her friends fight the greatest evil they have ever faced: Clary's own brother.Sebastian Morgenstern is on the move, systematically turning Shadowhunter against Shadowhunter.

War and Peace broadly focuses on Napoleon’s invasion of Russia in 1812 and follows three of the most well-known characters in literature: Pierre Bezukhov, the illegitimate son of a count who is fighting for his inheritance and yearning for spiritual fulfillment; Prince Andrei Bolkonsky, who leaves his family behind to fight in the war against Napoleon; and Natasha Rostov, the beautiful young daughter of a nobleman who intrigues both men.As Napoleon’s army invades, Tolstoy brilliantly follows characters from diverse backgrounds—peasants and nobility, civilians and soldiers—as they struggle with the problems unique to their era, their history, and their culture. And as the novel progresses, these characters transcend their specificity, becoming some of the most moving—and human—figures in world literature.Tolstoy gave his personal approval to this translation, published here in a new single volume edition, which includes an introduction by Henry Gifford, and Tolstoy's important essay `Some Words about War and Peace'.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1413215930i/656.jpg","publisher":"Oxford University Press","ratingsCount":306300,"reviewsCount":15297,"numPages":1392,"language":"English","rank":417,"year_publication":1869,"list_score":29696,"number_votes":363,"genres_list":"Historical Fiction, 19th Century, War, Fiction, Historical, Russia, Russian Literature, Classics, Novels, Literature","authors_list":"Aylmer Maude, Louise Maude, Leo Tolstoy","series_list":"","places_list":"Slavkov u Brna (Austerlitz), Olomuc (Olmütz), Russia, Moscow, St. Petersburg","awards_list":"","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":false,"Childrens":false,"Classics":true,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":true,"Historical":true,"Historical Fiction":true,"Literature":true,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":true,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":4.15,"filename":"book1282.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31685789-room","title":"Room","titleComplete":"Room","description":"To five-year-old-Jack, Room is the world....Told in the inventive, funny, and poignant voice of Jack, Room is a celebration of resilience—and a powerful story of a mother and son whose love lets them survive the impossible.To five-year-old Jack, Room is the entire world.

Greeted by fireworks displays, cheering crowds, and Prime Minister Nehru himself, Saleem grows up to learn the ominous consequences of this coincidence. His every act is mirrored and magnified in events that sway the course of national affairs; his health and well-being are inextricably bound to those of his nation; his life is inseparable, at times indistinguishable, from the history of his country.

Written more than two thousand years ago, the Tao Teh Ching, or -The Classic of the Way and Its Virtue, - is one of the true classics of the world of spiritual literature. Traditionally attributed to the legendary -Old Master, - Lao Tzu, the Tao Teh Ching teaches that the qualities of the enlightened sage or ideal ruler are identical with those of the perfected individual. Today, Lao Tzu's words are as useful in mastering the arts of leadership in business and politics as they are in developing a sense of balance and harmony in everyday life. To follow the Tao or Way of all things and realize their true nature is to embody humility, spontaneity, and generosity. John C. H. Wu has done a remarkable job of rendering this subtle text into English while retaining the freshness and depth of the original. A jurist and scholar, Dr. Wu was a recognized authority on Taoism and the translator of several Taoist and Zen texts and of Chinese poetry. This book is part of the Shambhala Pocket Library series. The Shambhala Pocket Library is a collection of short, portable teachings from notable figures across religious traditions and classic texts. The covers in this series are rendered by Colorado artist Robert Spellman. The books in this collection distill the wisdom and heart of the work Shambhala Publications has published over 50 years into a compact format that is collectible, reader-friendly, and applicable to everyday life.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1333578861i/67896.jpg","asin":"0679724346","isbn":"0679724346","isbn13":"9780679724346","publisher":"Vintage","ratingsCount":144122,"reviewsCount":6529,"numPages":160,"language":"English","rank":396,"year_publication":-350,"list_score":31502,"number_votes":400,"genres_list":"Taoism, Self Help, China, Spirituality, Philosophy, Classics, Religion, Nonfiction, Eastern Philosophy, Poetry","authors_list":"Gia-Fu Feng, James Legge, Brian Browne Walker, Vladimir Antonov, Jacob Needleman, Jane English, Lao Tzu, Claudio Lamparelli, Mikhail Nikolenko, Toinette Lippe","series_list":"الأعمال الكاملة فراس حواس","places_list":"","awards_list":"","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":false,"Childrens":false,"Classics":true,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":false,"Historical":false,"Historical Fiction":false,"Literature":false,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":true,"Novels":false,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":4.3,"filename":"book1303.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30597.Notre_Dame_de_Paris_The_Hunchback_of_Notre_Dame","title":"Notre-Dame de Paris | The Hunchback of Notre-Dame","titleComplete":"Notre-Dame de Paris | The Hunchback of Notre-Dame","description":"This extraordinary historical French gothic novel, set in Medieval Paris under the twin towers of its greatest structure and supreme symbol, the cathedral of Notre-Dame, is the haunting drama of Quasimodo, the disabled bell-ringer of Notre-Dame, as he struggles to stand up to his ableist guardian Claude Frollo, who also wants to commit genocide against Paris' Romani population.The novel has been described as a key text in French literature[1] and has been adapted for film over a dozen times, in addition to numerous television and stage adaptations, such as a 1923 silent film with Lon Chaney, a 1939 sound film with Charles Laughton, and a 1996 Disney animated film with Tom Hulce (both as Quasimodo).The novel sought to preserve values of French culture in a time period of great change, which resulted in the destruction of many French Gothic structures.

He had to learn how to play his mother's games in order to survive because she no longer considered him a son, but a slave; and no longer a boy, but an \"it.\" Dave's bed was an old army cot in the basement, and his clothes were torn and raunchy. When his mother allowed him the luxury of food, it was nothing more than spoiled scraps that even the dogs refused to eat. The outside world knew nothing of his living nightmare. He had nothing or no one to turn to, but his dreams kept him alive—dreams of someone taking care of him, loving him and calling him their son.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1438400434i/60748.jpg","publisher":"Health Communications Inc","ratingsCount":415334,"reviewsCount":17336,"numPages":184,"language":"English","rank":394,"year_publication":1995,"list_score":31646,"number_votes":411,"genres_list":"Biography, Memoir, True Story, Psychology, Abuse, Autobiography, True Crime, Adult, Nonfiction, Biography Memoir","authors_list":"Dave Pelzer","series_list":"Dave Pelzer","places_list":"","awards_list":"West Australian Young Readers' Book Award (WAYRBA), Soaring Eagle Book Award, Lincoln Award","Adult":true,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":false,"Childrens":false,"Classics":false,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":false,"Historical":false,"Historical Fiction":false,"Literature":false,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":true,"Novels":false,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":4.12,"filename":"book1305.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45032.Mansfield_Park","title":"Mansfield Park","titleComplete":"Mansfield Park","description":"Taken from the poverty of her parents' home in Portsmouth, Fanny Price is brought up with her rich cousins at Mansfield Park, acutely aware of her humble rank and with her cousin Edmund as her sole ally.

Now part of the Voyager Classics collection.The Martian Chronicles tells the story of humanity’s repeated attempts to colonize the red planet. The first men were few. Most succumbed to a disease they called the Great Loneliness when they saw their home planet dwindle to the size of a fist. They felt they had never been born. Those few that survived found no welcome on Mars. The shape-changing Martians thought they were native lunatics and duly locked them up.But more rockets arrived from Earth, and more, piercing the hallucinations projected by the Martians. People brought their old prejudices with them – and their desires and fantasies, tainted dreams.

Dick. The result is brilliantly original fiction as profund as it is playful. Now in his new novel, David Mitchell explores with daring artistry fundamental questions of reality and identity.Cloud Atlas begins in 1850 with Adam Ewing, an American notary voyaging from the Chatham Isles to his home in California. Along the way, Ewing is befriended by a physician, Dr. Goose, who begins to treat him for a rare species of brain parasite. . . .Abruptly, the action jumps to Belgium in 1931, where Robert Frobisher, a disinherited bisexual composer, contrives his way into the household of an infirm maestro who has a beguiling wife and a nubile daughter. . . . From there we jump to the West Coast in the 1970s and a troubled reporter named Luisa Rey, who stumbles upon a web of corporate greed and murder that threatens to claim her life. . . . And onward, with dazzling virtuosity, to an inglorious present-day England; to a Korean superstate of the near future where neocapitalism has run amok; and, finally, to a postapocalyptic Iron Age Hawaii in the last days of history.But the story doesn’t end even there. The narrative then boomerangs back through centuries and space, returning by the same route, in reverse, to its starting point. Along the way, Mitchell reveals how his disparate characters connect, how their fates intertwine, and how their souls drift across time like clouds across the sky.As wild as a videogame, as mysterious as a Zen koan, Cloud Atlas is an unforgettable tour de force that, like its incomparable author, has transcended its cult classic status to become a worldwide phenomenon.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1563042852i/49628.jpg","isbn":"0375507256","isbn13":"9780375507250","publisher":"Random House","ratingsCount":238423,"reviewsCount":21069,"numPages":509,"language":"English","rank":392,"year_publication":2004,"list_score":31833,"number_votes":384,"genres_list":"Historical Fiction, Contemporary, Historical, Fiction, Novels, Literary Fiction, Fantasy, Science Fiction, Literature, Dystopia","authors_list":"David Mitchell","series_list":"","places_list":"Seoul, South Korea, Buenas Yerbas, South Korea, London, England, Maui, Hawaii, Neerbeke, West Vlaanderen, The United States of America, England, Chatham Islands, Belgium","awards_list":"Booker Prize, Nebula Award, Locus Award, Arthur C.

The Quran is composed of verses (Ayat) that make up 114 chapters (suras) of unequal length which are classified either as Meccan (المكية) or Medinan (المدنية) depending upon the place and time of their claimed revelation. Muslims believe the Quran to be verbally revealed through the angel Jibrīl (Gabriel) from God to Muhammad gradually over a period of approximately 23 years beginning on 22 December 609 CE, when Muhammad was 40, and concluding in 632 CE, the year of his death.Muslims regard the Quran as the main miracle of Muhammad, the proof of his prophethood and the culmination of a series of divine messages that started with the messages revealed to Adam, regarded in Islam as the first prophet, and continued with Suhuf Ibrahim (Scrolls of Abraham), the Tawrat (Torah or Pentateuch) of Moses, the Zabur (Tehillim or Book of Psalms) of David, and the Injil (Gospel) of Jesus. The Quran assumes familiarity with major narratives recounted in Jewish and Christian scriptures, summarizing some, dwelling at length on others and in some cases presenting alternative accounts and interpretations of events. The Quran describes itself as a book of guidance, sometimes offering detailed accounts of specific historical events, and often emphasizing the moral significance of an event over its narrative sequence.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1275263838i/646462.jpg","ratingsCount":64826,"reviewsCount":3483,"numPages":604,"language":"Arabic","rank":379,"year_publication":632,"list_score":34123,"number_votes":384,"genres_list":"Spirituality, Philosophy, Reference, Islam, Classics, Theology, Religion, Mythology, Nonfiction, History","authors_list":"Anonymous, Yaşar Nuri Öztürk","series_list":"","places_list":"Mekka and Madina","awards_list":"","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":false,"Childrens":false,"Classics":true,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":false,"Historical":false,"Historical Fiction":false,"Literature":false,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":true,"Novels":false,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":4.38,"filename":"book1321.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5826.Bel_Canto","title":"Bel Canto","titleComplete":"Bel Canto","description":"Somewhere in South America, at the home of the country's vice president, a lavish birthday party is being held in honor of the powerful businessman Mr. Hosokawa.

Nominated as one of America’s best-loved novels by PBS’s The Great American Read.Gulliver's Travels describes the four voyages of Lemuel Gulliver, a ship's surgeon. In Lilliput he discovers a world in miniature; towering over the people and their city, he is able to view their society from the viewpoint of a god. However, in Brobdingnag, a land of giants, tiny Gulliver himself comes under observation, exhibited as a curiosity at markets and fairs. In Laputa, a flying island, he encounters a society of speculators and projectors who have lost all grip on everyday reality; while they plan and calculate, their country lies in ruins. Gulliver's final voyage takes him to the land of the Houyhnhnms, gentle horses whom he quickly comes to admire - in contrast to the Yahoos, filthy bestial creatures who bear a disturbing resemblance to humans. This text, based on the first edition of 1726, reproduces all the original illustrations and includes an introduction by Robert Demaria, Jr, which discusses the ways Gulliver's Travels has been interpreted since its first publication.

But they are not mere romances; ironic, comic and wise, they are masterly studies of the society Jane Austen observed.

Maus approaches the unspeakable through the diminutive. Its form, the cartoon (the Nazis are cats, the Jews mice), shocks us out of any lingering sense of familiarity and succeeds in “drawing us closer to the bleak heart of the Holocaust” (The New York Times).Maus is a haunting tale within a tale. Vladek’s harrowing story of survival is woven into the author’s account of his tortured relationship with his aging father. Against the backdrop of guilt brought by survival, they stage a normal life of small arguments and unhappy visits. This astonishing retelling of our century’s grisliest news is a story of survival, not only of Vladek but of the children who survive even the survivors. Maus studies the bloody pawprints of history and tracks its meaning for all of us.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327354180i/15195.jpg","asin":"0141014083","isbn":"0141014083","isbn13":"9780141014081","publisher":"Penguin Books","ratingsCount":194176,"reviewsCount":12140,"numPages":296,"language":"English","rank":358,"year_publication":1980,"list_score":36380,"number_votes":465,"genres_list":"Biography, Holocaust, Memoir, Historical, Graphic Novels, War, Classics, Comics, Nonfiction, History","authors_list":"Art Spiegelman","series_list":"Maus","places_list":"","awards_list":"Pulitzer Prize, American Book Award","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":false,"Childrens":false,"Classics":true,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":false,"Historical":true,"Historical Fiction":false,"Literature":false,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":true,"Novels":false,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":4.56,"filename":"book1342.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5805.V_for_Vendetta","title":"V for Vendetta","titleComplete":"V for Vendetta","description":"\"Remember, remember the fifth of November...\"A frightening and powerful tale of the loss of freedom and identity in a chillingly believable totalitarian world, V for Vendetta stands as one of the highest achievements of the comics medium and a defining work for creators Alan Moore and David Lloyd.Set in an imagined future England that has given itself over to fascism, this groundbreaking story captures both the suffocating nature of life in an authoritarian police state and the redemptive power of the human spirit which rebels against it.

But just so tiny and meaningless and—sad-making. And the worst part is, if you go bohemian or something crazy like that, you’re conforming just as much only in a different way.’First published in The New Yorker as two sequential stories, ‘Franny’ and ‘Zooey’ offer a dual portrait of the two youngest members of J. D. Salinger’s fictional Glass family.Franny Glass is a pretty, effervescent college student on a date with her intellectually confident boyfriend, Lane. They appear to be the perfect couple, but as they struggle to communicate with each other about the things they really care about, slowly their true feelings come to the surface. The second story in this book, ‘Zooey’, plunges us into the world of her ethereal, sophisticated family. When Franny’s emotional and spiritual doubts reach new heights, her older brother Zooey, a misanthropic former child genius, offers her consolation and brotherly advice.Written in Salinger’s typically irreverent style, these two stories offer a touching snapshot of the distraught mindset of early adulthood and are full of the insightful emotional observations and witty turns of phrase that have helped make Salinger’s reputation what it is today.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1355037988i/5113.jpg","asin":"0316769029","isbn":"0316769029","isbn13":"9780316769020","publisher":"Back Bay Books","ratingsCount":208830,"reviewsCount":8699,"numPages":201,"language":"English","rank":355,"year_publication":1957,"list_score":36693,"number_votes":470,"genres_list":"Adult Fiction, American, 20th Century, Fiction, Classics, Short Stories, Novels, Literary Fiction, Adult, Literature","authors_list":"J.D.

Set in the rich farmland of California’s Salinas Valley, this sprawling and often brutal novel follows the intertwined destinies of two families—the Trasks and the Hamiltons—whose generations helplessly reenact the fall of Adam and Eve and the poisonous rivalry of Cain and Abel.Adam Trask came to California from the East to farm and raise his family on the new rich land. But the birth of his twins, Cal and Aaron, brings his wife to the brink of madness, and Adam is left alone to raise his boys to manhood. One boy thrives nurtured by the love of all those around him; the other grows up in loneliness enveloped by a mysterious darkness.First published in 1952, East of Eden is the work in which Steinbeck created his most mesmerizing characters and explored his most enduring themes: the mystery of identity, the inexplicability of love, and the murderous consequences of love's absence. A masterpiece of Steinbeck's later years, East of Eden is a powerful and vastly ambitious novel that is at once a family saga and a modern retelling of the Book of Genesis.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1639969375i/4406.jpg","asin":"0142000655","isbn":"0142000655","isbn13":"9780142000656","publisher":"Penguin Books","ratingsCount":496623,"reviewsCount":25113,"numPages":601,"language":"English","rank":339,"year_publication":1952,"list_score":39050,"number_votes":465,"genres_list":"Historical Fiction, American, Historical, Fiction, Classic Literature, 20th Century, Classics, Novels, Literary Fiction, Literature","authors_list":"John Steinbeck","series_list":"","places_list":"Salinas Valley, California, California","awards_list":"Audie Award, Deutscher Hörbuchpreis, National Book Award Finalist","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":false,"Childrens":false,"Classics":true,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":true,"Historical":true,"Historical Fiction":true,"Literature":true,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":true,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":4.4,"filename":"book1360.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16735.The_Prince_of_Tides","title":"The Prince of Tides","titleComplete":"The Prince of Tides","description":"Pat Conroy has created a huge, brash thunderstorm of a novel, stinging with honesty and resounding with drama.

Edmund Wilson characterized it as a work \"quite uninhibited and beautifully written, which anticipates D. H.

Much of Walden's material is derived from Thoreau's journals and contains such engaging pieces as \"Reading\" and \"The Pond in the Winter\" Other famous sections involve Thoreau's visits with a Canadian woodcutter and with an Irish family, a trip to Concord, and a description of his bean field. This is the complete and authoritative text of Walden-as close to Thoreau's original intention as all available evidence allows.

His brain fuzz is lingering, even after the wolf Lupa told him he is a demigod and trained him to fight with the pen/sword in his pocket. Somehow Percy manages to make it to a camp for half-bloods, despite the fact that he has to keep killing monsters along the way. But the camp doesn't ring any bells with him. The only thing he can recall from his past is another name: Annabeth. HAZEL IS SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD. When she lived before, she didn't do a very good job of it. Sure, she was an obedient daughter, even when her mother was possessed by greed. But that was the problem—when the Voice took over her mother and commanded Hazel to use her \"gift\" for an evil purpose, Hazel couldn't say no. Now because of her mistake, the future of the world is at risk. Hazel wishes she could ride away from it all on the stallion that appears in her dreams.FRANK IS A KLUTZ. His grandmother says he is descended from heroes and can be anything he wants to be, but he doesn't see it. He doesn't even know who his father is.

Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them, and won by them.One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where ten armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of Kings.

With a speculative leap that still fires the imagination, Wells sends his brave explorer to face a future burdened with our greatest hopes...and our darkest fears. A pull of the Time Machine’s lever propels him to the age of a slowly dying Earth.  There he discovers two bizarre races—the ethereal Eloi and the subterranean Morlocks—who not only symbolize the duality of human nature, but offer a terrifying portrait of the men of tomorrow as well.  Published in 1895, this masterpiece of invention captivated readers on the threshold of a new century.

Its students are well tended and supported, trained in art and literature, and become just the sort of people the world wants them to be. But, curiously, they are taught nothing of the outside world and are allowed little contact with it.Within the grounds of Hailsham, Kathy grows from schoolgirl to young woman, but it’s only when she and her friends Ruth and Tommy leave the safe grounds of the school (as they always knew they would) that they realize the full truth of what Hailsham is.Never Let Me Go breaks through the boundaries of the literary novel. It is a gripping mystery, a beautiful love story, and also a scathing critique of human arrogance and a moral examination of how we treat the vulnerable and different in our society. In exploring the themes of memory and the impact of the past, Ishiguro takes on the idea of a possible future to create his most moving and powerful book to date.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1353048590i/6334.jpg","asin":"1400078776","publisher":"Vintage Books ","ratingsCount":612776,"reviewsCount":44320,"numPages":288,"language":"English","rank":312,"year_publication":2005,"list_score":45678,"number_votes":554,"genres_list":"Contemporary, Adult, Fiction, Classics, Novels, Literary Fiction, Romance, Science Fiction, Literature, Dystopia","authors_list":"Kazuo Ishiguro","series_list":"","places_list":"Hailsham, England, United Kingdom","awards_list":"Booker Prize, Locus Award, Arthur C.

The enigmatic Winter has spent six decades creating various outlandish life histories for herself -- all of them inventions that have brought her fame and fortune but have kept her violent and tragic past a secret. Now old and ailing, she at last wants to tell the truth about her extraordinary life. She summons biographer Margaret Lea, a young woman for whom the secret of her own birth, hidden by those who loved her most, remains an ever-present pain. Struck by a curious parallel between Miss Winter's story and her own, Margaret takes on the commission. As Vida disinters the life she meant to bury for good, Margaret is mesmerized. It is a tale of gothic strangeness featuring the Angelfield family, including the beautiful and willful Isabelle, the feral twins Adeline and Emmeline, a ghost, a governess, a topiary garden and a devastating fire. Margaret succumbs to the power of Vida's storytelling but remains suspicious of the author's sincerity. She demands the truth from Vida, and together they confront the ghosts that have haunted them while becoming, finally, transformed by the truth themselves. The Thirteenth Tale is a love letter to reading, a book for the feral reader in all of us, a return to that rich vein of storytelling that our parents loved and that we loved as children. Diane Setterfield will keep you guessing, make you wonder, move you to tears and laughter and, in the end, deposit you breathless yet satisfied back upon the shore of your everyday life.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1346267826i/40440.jpg","asin":"0743298020","isbn":"0743298020","isbn13":"9780743298025","publisher":"Atria Books","ratingsCount":302513,"reviewsCount":25553,"numPages":406,"language":"English","rank":310,"year_publication":2006,"list_score":45817,"number_votes":554,"genres_list":"Historical Fiction, Mystery, Book Club, Gothic, Historical, Fiction, Mystery Thriller, Books About Books, Adult, Fantasy","authors_list":"Diane Setterfield","series_list":"","places_list":"Angelfield","awards_list":"Dilys Award, ALA Alex Award, The Quill Award","Adult":true,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":false,"Childrens":false,"Classics":false,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":true,"Fiction":true,"Historical":true,"Historical Fiction":true,"Literature":false,"Magic":false,"Mystery":true,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":false,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":3.97,"filename":"book1390.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/569564.The_Complete_Works","title":"The Complete Works","titleComplete":"The Complete Works","description":"Tempest\tTwo Gentlemen of Verona\tMerry Wives of Windsor\tMeasure for Measure\tComedy of Errors\tMuch Ado About Nothing\tLove's Labour's Lost\tMidsummer Night's Dream\tMerchant of Venice\tAs You Like It\tTaming of the Shrew\tAll's Well That Ends Well\tTwelfth Night\tWinter's Tale\tKing John\tKing Richard II\tKing Henry IV.

The struggle rages across three worlds - heaven, hell, and earth - as Satan and his band of rebel angels plot their revenge against God. At the center of the conflict are Adam and Eve, who are motivated by all too human temptations but whose ultimate downfall is unyielding love.Marked by Milton's characteristic erudition, Paradise Lost is a work epic both in scale and, notoriously, in ambition.

The letters are all addressed to \"My dear and unfortunate successor,\" and they plunge her into a world she never dreamed of, a labyrinth where the secrets of her father's past and her mother's mysterious fate connect to an inconceivable evil hidden in the depths of history.The letters provide links to one of the darkest powers that humanity has ever known and to a centuries-long quest to find the source of that darkness and wipe it out. It is a quest for the truth about Vlad the Impaler, the medieval ruler whose barbarous reign formed the basis of the legend of Dracula. Generations of historians have risked their reputations, their sanity, and even their lives to learn the truth about Vlad the Impaler and Dracula. Now one young woman must decide whether to take up this quest herself--to follow her father in a hunt that nearly brought him to ruin years ago, when he was a vibrant young scholar and her mother was still alive. What does the legend of Vlad the Impaler have to do with the modern world? Is it possible that the Dracula of myth truly existed and that he has lived on, century after century, pursuing his own unknowable ends? The answers to these questions cross time and borders, as first the father and then the daughter search for clues, from dusty Ivy League libraries to Istanbul, Budapest, and the depths of Eastern Europe. In city after city, in monasteries and archives, in letters and in secret conversations, the horrible truth emerges about Vlad the Impaler's dark reign and about a time-defying pact that may have kept his awful work alive down through the ages.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1592232171i/30236962.jpg","asin":"B000FCK6EI","publisher":" Little, Brown and Company","ratingsCount":257775,"reviewsCount":17538,"numPages":704,"language":"English","rank":303,"year_publication":2005,"list_score":46689,"number_votes":561,"genres_list":"Historical Fiction, Mystery, Gothic, Historical, Fiction, Paranormal, Thriller, Vampires, Fantasy, Horror","authors_list":"Elizabeth Kostova","series_list":"","places_list":"Amsterdam, Istanbul, Oxford University, Oxford, England, England, Hungary, Turkey, Netherlands, Budapest","awards_list":"International Horror Guild Award, Hopwood Award, Book Sense Book of the Year Award, The Quill Award, Lord Ruthven Award","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":false,"Childrens":false,"Classics":false,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":true,"Fiction":true,"Historical":true,"Historical Fiction":true,"Literature":false,"Magic":false,"Mystery":true,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":false,"Paranormal":true,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":true,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":3.79,"filename":"book1396.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28881.Lamb","title":"Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal","titleComplete":"Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal","description":"The birth of Jesus has been well chronicled, as have his glorious teachings, acts, and divine sacrifice after his thirtieth birthday. But no one knows about the early life of the Son of God, the missing years—except Biff, the Messiah's best bud, who has been resurrected to tell the story in the divinely hilarious yet heartfelt work \"reminiscent of Vonnegut and Douglas Adams\" (Philadelphia Inquirer).Verily, the story Biff has to tell is a miraculous one, filled with remarkable journeys, magic, healings, kung fu, corpse reanimations, demons, and hot babes. Even the considerable wiles and devotion of the Savior's pal may not be enough to divert Joshua from his tragic destiny. But there's no one who loves Josh more—except maybe \"Maggie,\" Mary of Magdala—and Biff isn't about to let his extraordinary pal suffer and ascend without a fight.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1331419009i/28881.jpg","asin":"0380813815","isbn":"0380813815","isbn13":"9780380813810","publisher":"Harper Perennial","ratingsCount":167726,"reviewsCount":12598,"numPages":444,"language":"English","rank":304,"year_publication":2002,"list_score":46600,"number_votes":521,"genres_list":"Historical Fiction, Humor, Audiobook, Historical, Fiction, Novels, Religion, Fantasy, Adult, Comedy","authors_list":"Christopher Moore","series_list":"","places_list":"Israel","awards_list":"","Adult":true,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":true,"Childrens":false,"Classics":false,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":true,"Fiction":true,"Historical":true,"Historical Fiction":true,"Literature":false,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":true,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":4.23,"filename":"book1397.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33.The_Lord_of_the_Rings","title":"The Lord of the Rings","titleComplete":"The Lord of the Rings","description":"One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind themIn ancient times the Rings of Power were crafted by the Elven-smiths, and Sauron, the Dark Lord, forged the One Ring, filling it with his own power so that he could rule all others. But the One Ring was taken from him, and though he sought it throughout Middle-earth, it remained lost to him. After many ages it fell by chance into the hands of the hobbit Bilbo Baggins.From Sauron's fastness in the Dark Tower of Mordor, his power spread far and wide. Sauron gathered all the Great Rings to him, but always he searched for the One Ring that would complete his dominion.When Bilbo reached his eleventy-first birthday he disappeared, bequeathing to his young cousin Frodo the Ruling Ring and a perilous quest: to journey across Middle-earth, deep into the shadow of the Dark Lord, and destroy the Ring by casting it into the Cracks of Doom.The Lord of the Rings tells of the great quest undertaken by Frodo and the Fellowship of the Ring: Gandalf the Wizard; the hobbits Merry, Pippin, and Sam; Gimli the Dwarf; Legolas the Elf; Boromir of Gondor; and a tall, mysterious stranger called Strider.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1566425108i/33.jpg","publisher":"Houghton Mifflin Harcourt","ratingsCount":637967,"reviewsCount":13602,"numPages":1216,"language":"English","rank":300,"year_publication":1955,"list_score":47792,"number_votes":573,"genres_list":"Science Fiction Fantasy, Epic Fantasy, Fiction, Classics, Novels, Young Adult, Fantasy, High Fantasy, Literature, Adventure","authors_list":"J.R.R.

A woman of sublime intelligence, Hypatia ranks above not only all women, but all men. Hypatia dazzled the world with her brilliance, was courted by men of every persuasion and was considered the leading philosopher and mathematician of her age ... yet her mathematics, her inventions, the very story of her life in all its epic and dramatic intensity, has gone untold.

Its figures harden their hearts, engage in violence, or try to alleviate the suffering of others. Lear himself rages until his sanity cracks. What, then, keeps bringing us back to King Lear? For all the force of its language, King Lear is almost equally powerful when translated, suggesting that it is the story, in large part, that draws us to the play.The play tells us about families struggling between greed and cruelty, on the one hand, and support and consolation, on the other. Emotions are extreme, magnified to gigantic proportions. We also see old age portrayed in all its vulnerability, pride, and, perhaps, wisdom—one reason this most devastating of Shakespeare’s tragedies is also perhaps his most moving.The authoritative edition of King Lear from The Folger Shakespeare Library, the trusted and widely used Shakespeare series for students and general readers, includes:-Freshly edited text based on the best early printed version of the play-Full explanatory notes conveniently placed on pages facing the text of the play-Scene-by-scene plot summaries-A key to the play’s famous lines and phrases-An introduction to reading Shakespeare’s language-An essay by a leading Shakespeare scholar providing a modern perspective on the play-Fresh images from the Folger Shakespeare Library’s vast holdings of rare books-An annotated guide to further readingEssay by Susan SnyderThe Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC, is home to the world’s largest collection of Shakespeare’s printed works, and a magnet for Shakespeare scholars from around the globe.

Their odyssey, as mysterious to them as it is to us, is enriched throughout by vivid accomplices and mesmerizing events. Cats and people carry on conversations, a ghostlike pimp employs a Hegel-quoting prostitute, a forest harbors soldiers apparently unaged since World War II, and rainstorms of fish (and worse) fall from the sky. There is a brutal murder, with the identity of both victim and perpetrator a riddle—yet this, along with everything else, is eventually answered, just as the entwined destinies of Kafka and Nakata are gradually revealed, with one escaping his fate entirely and the other given a fresh start on his own.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1429638085i/4929.jpg","asin":"1400079276","isbn":"1400079276","isbn13":"9781400079278","publisher":"Vintage International","ratingsCount":413999,"reviewsCount":32096,"numPages":467,"language":"English","rank":287,"year_publication":2002,"list_score":49938,"number_votes":566,"genres_list":"Contemporary, Fiction, Classics, Novels, Literary Fiction, Fantasy, Magical Realism, Literature, Japanese Literature, Japan","authors_list":"Philip Gabriel, Haruki Murakami","series_list":"","places_list":"Takamatsu","awards_list":"World Fantasy Award, Los Angeles Times Book Prize, Independent Foreign Fiction Prize, PEN Translation Prize, Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis, Tähtifantasia Award, Βραβείο Βιβλίου Public","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":false,"Childrens":false,"Classics":true,"Contemporary":true,"Fantasy":true,"Fiction":true,"Historical":false,"Historical Fiction":false,"Literature":true,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":true,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":4.14,"filename":"book1414.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11505797-beautiful-disaster","title":"Beautiful Disaster","titleComplete":"Beautiful Disaster (Beautiful, #1)","description":"The new Abby Abernathy is a good girl.

He had given $25,000 in savings to charity, abandoned his car and most of his possessions, burned all the cash in his wallet, and invented a new life for himself. Four months later, a party of moose hunters found his decomposed body. How McCandless came to die is the unforgettable story of Into the Wild.Immediately after graduating from college in 1991, McCandless had roamed through the West and Southwest on a vision quest like those made by his heroes Jack London and John Muir. In the Mojave Desert he abandoned his car, stripped it of its license plates, and burned all of his cash. He would give himself a new name, Alexander Supertramp, and, unencumbered by money and belongings, he would be free to wallow in the raw, unfiltered experiences that nature presented. Craving a blank spot on the map, McCandless simply threw away the maps.

However, its troubles only served to increase the interest of Daily Telegraph correspondent Tim Butcher, who was sent to cover Africa in 2000. Before long he became obsessed with the idea of recreating Stanley’s original expedition — but travelling alone.Despite warnings Butcher spent years poring over colonial-era maps and wooing rebel leaders before making his will and venturing to the Congo’s eastern border. He passed through once thriving cities of this country and saw the marks left behind by years of abuse and misrule. Almost, 2,500 harrowing miles later, he reached the Atlantic Ocean, a thinner and a wiser man.Butcher’s journey was a remarkable feat.

He sets this story in the romantic world of the Mediterranean, moving the action from Venice to the island of Cyprus and giving it an even more exotic coloring with stories of Othello's African past. Shakespeare builds so many differences into his hero and heroine—differences of race, of age, of cultural background—that one should not, perhaps, be surprised that the marriage ends disastrously. But most people who see or read the play feel that the love that the play presents between Othello and Desdemona is so strong that it would have overcome all these differences were it not for the words and actions of Othello's standard-bearer, Iago, who hates Othello and sets out to destroy him by destroying his love for Desdemona. As Othello succumbs to Iago's insinuations that Desdemona is unfaithful, fascination—which dominates the early acts of the play—turns to horror, especially for the audience. We are confronted by spectacles of a generous and trusting Othello in the grip of Iago's schemes; of an innocent Desdemona, who has given herself up entirely to her love for Othello only to be subjected to his horrifying verbal and physical assaults, the outcome of Othello's mistaken convictions about her faithlessness.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1459795105i/12996.jpg","publisher":"Simon & Schuster","ratingsCount":364518,"reviewsCount":8768,"numPages":314,"language":"English","rank":279,"year_publication":1603,"list_score":51148,"number_votes":734,"genres_list":"Drama, School, Read For School, Tragedy, Fiction, Classics, Plays, Theatre, Literature, Poetry","authors_list":"Paul Werstine, William Shakespeare, Barbara A.

She is friendless, outcast, because she busted an end-of-summer party by calling the cops, so now nobody will talk to her, let alone listen to her. As time passes, she becomes increasingly isolated and practically stops talking altogether. Only her art class offers any solace, and it is through her work on an art project that she is finally able to face what really happened at that terrible party: she was raped by an upperclassman, a guy who still attends Merryweather and is still a threat to her. Her healing process has just begun when she has another violent encounter with him. But this time Melinda fights back, refuses to be silent, and thereby achieves a measure of vindication. In Laurie Halse Anderson's powerful novel, an utterly believable heroine with a bitterly ironic voice delivers a blow to the hypocritical world of high school. She speaks for many a disenfranchised teenager while demonstrating the importance of speaking up for oneself.Speak was a 1999 National Book Award Finalist for Young People's Literature.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1529044298i/39280444.jpg","asin":"0374311250","isbn":"0374311250","isbn13":"9780374311254","publisher":"Farrar, Straus and Giroux (Byr)","ratingsCount":558408,"reviewsCount":28555,"numPages":224,"language":"English","rank":274,"year_publication":1999,"list_score":52506,"number_votes":643,"genres_list":"Contemporary, Teen, School, Coming Of Age, Abuse, Fiction, High School, Mental Health, Young Adult, Realistic Fiction","authors_list":"Laurie Halse Anderson","series_list":"","places_list":"Syracuse, New York","awards_list":"SCBWI Golden Kite Award, Edgar Award, Michael L.

It took ten years and a half a million miles of travel across three continents to find it, but finally, in an astonishing feat of genealogical detective work, he discovered not only the name of \"the African\"—Kunta Kinte—but the precise location of Juffure, the very village in The Gambia, West Africa, from which he was abducted in 1767 at the age of sixteen and taken on the Lord Ligonier to Maryland and sold to a Virginia planter.Haley has talked in Juffure with his own African sixth cousins. On September 29, 1967, he stood on the dock in Annapolis where his great-great-great-great-grandfather was taken ashore on September 29, 1767. Now he has written the monumental two-century drama of Kunta Kinte and the six generations who came after him—slaves and freedmen, farmers and blacksmiths, lumber mill workers and Pullman porters, lawyers and architects—and one author.But Haley has done more than recapture the history of his own family. As the first black American writer to trace his origins back to their roots, he has told the story of 25,000,000 Americans of African descent. He has rediscovered for an entire people a rich cultural heritage that slavery took away from them, along with their names and their identities. But Roots speaks, finally, not just to blacks, or to whites, but to all people and all races everywhere, for the story it tells is one of the most eloquent testimonials ever written to the indomitability of the human spirit.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1329398936i/546018.jpg","asin":"9992652659","isbn":"0440174643","isbn13":"9780440174646","publisher":"Dell Publishing Company","ratingsCount":156363,"reviewsCount":4000,"numPages":888,"language":"English","rank":273,"year_publication":1976,"list_score":52618,"number_votes":692,"genres_list":"Historical Fiction, African American, Historical, Fiction, Africa, Classics, Race, Novels, Audiobook, Literature","authors_list":"Alex Haley","series_list":"","places_list":"Gambia, The United States of America","awards_list":"ASJA Outstanding Book Award, Audie Award, Premio Bancarella, National Book Critics Circle Award, Lillian Smith Book Award","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":true,"Childrens":false,"Classics":true,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":true,"Historical":true,"Historical Fiction":true,"Literature":true,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":true,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":4.44,"filename":"book1426.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24812.The_Complete_Calvin_and_Hobbes","title":"The Complete Calvin and Hobbes","titleComplete":"The Complete Calvin and Hobbes","description":"[ \n  Box Set\n | Book One | Book Two | Book Three ]Calvin and Hobbes is unquestionably one of the most popular comic strips of all time.

Perhaps there is some sort of secret homing instinct in books that brings them to their perfect readers.\" January 1946: London is emerging from the shadow of the Second World War, and writer Juliet Ashton is looking for her next book subject. Who could imagine that she would find it in a letter from a man she's never met, a native of the island of Guernsey, who has come across her name written inside a book by Charles Lamb...As Juliet and her new correspondent exchange letters, Juliet is drawn into the world of this man and his friends—and what a wonderfully eccentric world it is. The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society—born as a spur-of-the-moment alibi when its members were discovered breaking curfew by the Germans occupying their island—boasts a charming, funny, deeply human cast of characters, from pig farmers to phrenologists, literature lovers all.Juliet begins a remarkable correspondence with the society's members, learning about their island, their taste in books, and the impact the recent German occupation has had on their lives.

Anything anyone tells her to do, Ella must obey. Another girl might have been cowed by this affliction, but not feisty Ella: \"Instead of making me docile, Lucinda's curse made a rebel of me. Or perhaps I was that way naturally.\" When her beloved mother dies, leaving her in the care of a mostly absent and avaricious father, and later, a loathsome stepmother and two treacherous stepsisters, Ella's life and well-being seem to be in grave peril. But her intelligence and saucy nature keep her in good stead as she sets out on a quest for freedom and self-discovery as she tries to track down Lucinda to undo the curse, fending off ogres, befriending elves, and falling in love with a prince along the way. Yes, there is a pumpkin coach, a glass slipper, and a happily ever after, but this is the most remarkable, delightful, and profound version of Cinderella you'll ever read.Gail Carson Levine's examination of traditional female roles in fairy tales takes some satisfying twists and deviations from the original. Ella is bound by obedience against her will, and takes matters in her own hands with ambition and verve. Her relationship with the prince is balanced and based on humor and mutual respect; in fact, it is she who ultimately rescues him. Ella Enchanted has won many well-deserved awards, including a Newbery Honor.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1410727190i/24337.jpg","asin":"0590920685","isbn":"0590920685","isbn13":"9780590920681","publisher":"Scholastic Books","ratingsCount":404382,"reviewsCount":11522,"numPages":232,"language":"English","rank":259,"year_publication":1997,"list_score":57697,"number_votes":718,"genres_list":"Retellings, Fairy Tales, Fiction, Magic, Childrens, Young Adult, Fantasy, Romance, Middle Grade, Adventure","authors_list":"Gail Carson Levine","series_list":"Ella Enchanted","places_list":"","awards_list":"Newbery Medal, Mythopoeic Fantasy Award, Grand Canyon Reader Award, Maryland Black-Eyed Susan Book Award, Vermont Golden Dome Book Award, Iowa Teen Award, California Young Readers Medal, Rebecca Caudill Young Readers' Book Award","Adult":false,"Adventure":true,"Audiobook":false,"Childrens":true,"Classics":false,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":true,"Fiction":true,"Historical":false,"Historical Fiction":false,"Literature":false,"Magic":true,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":false,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":true,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":true,"avgRating":4,"filename":"book1441.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6294.Howl_s_Moving_Castle","title":"Howl’s Moving Castle","titleComplete":"Howl’s Moving Castle (Howl’s Moving Castle, #1)","description":"An alternative cover for this ISBN can be found hereSophie has the great misfortune of being the eldest of three daughters, destined to fail miserably should she ever leave home to seek her fate.

The meager facts of his biography have been gleaned from a handful of legal documents. Yet Vermeer's extraordinary paintings of domestic life, with their subtle play of light and texture, have come to define the Dutch golden age. His portrait of the anonymous Girl with a Pearl Earring has exerted a particular fascination for centuries—and it is this magnetic painting that lies at the heart of Tracy Chevalier's second novel of the same title.Girl with a Pearl Earring centers on Vermeer's prosperous Delft household during the 1660s. When Griet, the novel's quietly perceptive heroine, is hired as a servant, turmoil follows. First, the 16-year-old narrator becomes increasingly intimate with her master. Then Vermeer employs her as his assistant—and ultimately has Griet sit for him as a model.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327197580i/2865.jpg","asin":"0452287022","isbn":"0452287022","isbn13":"9780452287020","publisher":"Plume/Penguin","ratingsCount":706112,"reviewsCount":11531,"numPages":233,"language":"English","rank":254,"year_publication":1999,"list_score":59521,"number_votes":776,"genres_list":"Historical Fiction, Adult Fiction, Adult, Historical, Fiction, Classics, Art, Novels, Romance, Literature","authors_list":"Tracy Chevalier","series_list":"","places_list":"Netherlands, Delft","awards_list":"Orange Prize, ALA Alex Award, Lincoln Award, Premi Llibreter de narrativa","Adult":true,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":false,"Childrens":false,"Classics":true,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":true,"Historical":true,"Historical Fiction":true,"Literature":true,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":true,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":true,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":3.92,"filename":"book1445.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/480204.The_Phantom_of_the_Opera","title":"The Phantom of the Opera","titleComplete":"The Phantom of the Opera","description":"First published in French as a serial in 1909, The Phantom of the Opera is a riveting story that revolves around the young, Swedish Christine Daaé. Her father, a famous musician, dies, and she is raised in the Paris Opera House with his dying promise of a protective angel of music to guide her. After a time at the opera house, she begins hearing a voice, who eventually teaches her how to sing beautifully. All goes well until Christine's childhood friend Raoul comes to visit his parents, who are patrons of the opera, and he sees Christine when she begins successfully singing on the stage. The voice, who is the deformed, murderous 'ghost' of the opera house named Erik, however, grows violent in his terrible jealousy, until Christine suddenly disappears. The phantom is in love, but it can only spell disaster.Leroux's work, with characters ranging from the spoiled prima donna Carlotta to the mysterious Persian from Erik's past, has been immortalized by memorable adaptations. Despite this, it remains a remarkable piece of Gothic horror literature in and of itself, deeper and darker than any version that follows.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327867727i/480204.jpg","asin":"0060809248","isbn":"0060809248","isbn13":"9780060809249","publisher":"Harper Perennial","ratingsCount":225222,"reviewsCount":9366,"numPages":360,"language":"English","rank":253,"year_publication":1909,"list_score":59837,"number_votes":761,"genres_list":"Historical Fiction, Mystery, Gothic, Fiction, Romance, Classics, France, Fantasy, Horror, Literature","authors_list":"Alexander Teixeira de Mattos, Gaston Leroux","series_list":"","places_list":"Paris, Bretagne, France","awards_list":"","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":false,"Childrens":false,"Classics":true,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":true,"Fiction":true,"Historical":false,"Historical Fiction":true,"Literature":true,"Magic":false,"Mystery":true,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":false,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":true,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":3.96,"filename":"book1446.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/561909.The_Hiding_Place","title":"The Hiding Place: The Triumphant True Story of Corrie Ten Boom","titleComplete":"The Hiding Place: The Triumphant True Story of Corrie Ten Boom","description":"At one time Corrie ten Boom would have laughed at the idea that there would ever be a story to tell.

She was an old-maid watchmaker living contentedly with her spinster sister and their elderly father in the tiny Dutch house over their shop. Their uneventful days, as regulated as their own watches, revolved around their abiding love for one another. However, with the Nazi invasion and occupation of Holland, a story did ensue. Corrie ten Boom and her family became leaders in the Dutch Underground, hiding Jewish people in their home in a specially built room and aiding their escape from the Nazis.

In the state of Kerala, on the southernmost tip of India, a skyblue Plymouth with chrome tailfins is stranded on the highway amid a Marxist workers' demonstration. Inside the car sit two-egg twins Rahel and Esthappen, and so begins their tale. . . .Armed only with the invincible innocence of children, they fashion a childhood for themselves in the shade of the wreck that is their family—their lonely, lovely mother, Ammu (who loves by night the man her children love by day), their blind grandmother, Mammachi (who plays Handel on her violin), their beloved uncle Chacko (Rhodes scholar, pickle baron, radical Marxist, bottom-pincher), their enemy, Baby Kochamma (ex-nun and incumbent grandaunt), and the ghost of an imperial entomologist's moth (with unusually dense dorsal tufts).When their English cousin, Sophie Mol, and her mother, Margaret Kochamma, arrive on a Christmas visit, Esthappen and Rahel learn that Things Can Change in a Day. That lives can twist into new, ugly shapes, even cease forever, beside their river \"graygreen.\" With fish in it. With the sky and trees in it. And at night, the broken yellow moon in it.The brilliantly plotted story uncoils with an agonizing sense of foreboding and inevitability. Yet nothing prepares you for what lies at the heart of it.The God of Small Things takes on the Big Themes—Love. Madness. Hope. Infinite Joy. Here is a writer who dares to break the rules. To dislocate received rhythms and create the language she requires, a language that is at once classical and unprecedented.

Based on historical people and real events, Miller's drama is a searing portrait of a community engulfed by hysteria. In the rigid theocracy of Salem, rumors that women are practicing witchcraft galvanize the town's most basic fears and suspicions; and when a young girl accuses Elizabeth Proctor of being a witch, self-righteous church leaders and townspeople insist that Elizabeth be brought to trial. The ruthlessness of the prosecutors and the eagerness of neighbor to testify against neighbor brilliantly illuminates the destructive power of socially sanctioned violence.Written in 1953, The Crucible is a mirror Miller uses to reflect the anti-communist hysteria inspired by Senator Joseph McCarthy's \"witch-hunts\" in the United States. Within the text itself, Miller contemplates the parallels, writing, \"Political opposition... is given an inhumane overlay, which then justifies the abrogation of all normally applied customs of civilized behavior.

A poignant look at the disillusionment and angst of the post-World War I generation, the novel introduces two of Hemingway's most unforgettable characters: Jake Barnes and Lady Brett Ashley. The story follows the flamboyant Brett and the hapless Jake as they journey from the wild nightlife of 1920s Paris to the brutal bullfighting rings of Spain with a motley group of expatriates. It is an age of moral bankruptcy, spiritual dissolution, unrealized love, and vanishing illusions. First published in 1926, The Sun Also Rises helped to establish Hemingway as one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1509802323i/3876.jpg","publisher":"Pan Books","ratingsCount":414242,"reviewsCount":16307,"numPages":189,"language":"English","rank":241,"year_publication":1926,"list_score":65124,"number_votes":831,"genres_list":"Historical Fiction, School, American, 20th Century, Fiction, Spain, Classics, Novels, Literary Fiction, Literature","authors_list":"Ernest Hemingway","series_list":"","places_list":"San Sebastián, Madrid, Pamplona, Spain, Basque Country, France, Paris","awards_list":"","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":false,"Childrens":false,"Classics":true,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":true,"Historical":false,"Historical Fiction":true,"Literature":true,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":true,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":3.8,"filename":"book1459.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/310612.A_Confederacy_of_Dunces","title":"A Confederacy of Dunces","titleComplete":"A Confederacy of Dunces","description":"Meet Ignatius J. Reilly, the hero of John Kennedy Toole's tragicomic tale, A Confederacy of Dunces. This 30-year-old medievalist lives at home with his mother in New Orleans, pens his magnum opus on Big Chief writing pads he keeps hidden under his bed, and relays to anyone who will listen the traumatic experience he once had on a Greyhound Scenicruiser bound for Baton Rouge. (\"Speeding along in that bus was like hurtling into the abyss.\") But Ignatius's quiet life of tyrannizing his mother and writing his endless comparative history screeches to a halt when he is almost arrested by the overeager Patrolman Mancuso--who mistakes him for a vagrant--and then involved in a car accident with his tipsy mother behind the wheel. One thing leads to another, and before he knows it, Ignatius is out pounding the pavement in search of a job.Over the next several hundred pages, our hero stumbles from one adventure to the next. His stint as a hotdog vendor is less than successful, and he soon turns his employers at the Levy Pants Company on their heads. Ignatius's path through the working world is populated by marvelous secondary characters: the stripper Darlene and her talented cockatoo; the septuagenarian secretary Miss Trixie, whose desperate attempts to retire are constantly, comically thwarted; gay blade Dorian Greene; sinister Miss Lee, proprietor of the Night of Joy nightclub; and Myrna Minkoff, the girl Ignatius loves to hate. The many subplots that weave through A Confederacy of Dunces are as complicated as anything you'll find in a Dickens novel, and just as beautifully tied together in the end. But it is Ignatius--selfish, domineering, and deluded, tragic and comic and larger than life--who carries the story. He is a modern-day Quixote beset by giants of the modern age. His fragility cracks the shell of comic bluster, revealing a deep streak of melancholy beneath the antic humor. John Kennedy Toole committed suicide in 1969 and never saw the publication of his novel. Ignatius Reilly is what he left behind, a fitting memorial to a talented and tormented life. --Alix Wilber","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1562554946i/310612.jpg","asin":"0802130208","isbn":"0802130208","isbn13":"9780802130204","publisher":"Grove Weidenfeld","ratingsCount":261044,"reviewsCount":17429,"numPages":394,"language":"English","rank":238,"year_publication":1980,"list_score":65468,"number_votes":756,"genres_list":"Contemporary, Humor, American, Fiction, Classics, Novels, Literary Fiction, Audiobook, Comedy, Literature","authors_list":"Walker Percy, John Kennedy Toole","series_list":"","places_list":"New Orleans, Louisiana","awards_list":"Pulitzer Prize, PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction, Los Angeles Times Book Prize","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":true,"Childrens":false,"Classics":true,"Contemporary":true,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":true,"Historical":false,"Historical Fiction":false,"Literature":true,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":true,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":3.88,"filename":"book1460.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/514811.The_Secret_Magdalene","title":"The Secret Magdalene","titleComplete":"The Secret Magdalene","description":"Raised like sisters, Mariamne and Salome are indulged with riches, position, and learning—a rare thing for females in Jerusalem.

Salome too begins to believe, but Mariamne, now called Magdalene, is drawn to his cousin, Yeshu'a, a man touched by the divine in the same way she was during her days of illness. Together they speak of sharing their direct experience of God; but Yeshu'a unexpectedly gains a reputation as a healer, and as the ill and the troubled flock to him, he and Magdalene are forced to make a terrible decision.This radical retelling of the greatest story ever told brings Mary Magdalene to life—not as a prostitute or demon-possessed—but as an educated woman who was truly the \"apostle to the apostles.\"From the Hardcover edition.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1175446011i/514811.jpg","asin":"0307346668","isbn":"0307346668","isbn13":"9780307346667","publisher":"Crown","ratingsCount":4424,"reviewsCount":490,"numPages":448,"language":"English","rank":239,"year_publication":2005,"list_score":65375,"number_votes":671,"genres_list":"Historical Fiction, Contemporary, Historical, Fiction, Spirituality, Biblical Fiction, Novels, Religion, Biblical, Literature","authors_list":"Ki Longfellow","series_list":"","places_list":"","awards_list":"","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":false,"Childrens":false,"Classics":false,"Contemporary":true,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":true,"Historical":true,"Historical Fiction":true,"Literature":true,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":true,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":4.16,"filename":"book1461.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1375.The_Iliad_The_Odyssey","title":"The Iliad / The Odyssey","titleComplete":"The Iliad / The Odyssey","description":"Gripping listeners and readers for more than 2,700 years, 'The Iliad' is the story of the Trojan War and the rage of Achilles.

Thrust into the closed society that is seventeenth-century Japan, a land where the line between life and death is razor-thin, Blackthorne must negotiate not only a foreign people, with unknown customs and language, but also his own definitions of morality, truth, and freedom. As internal political strife and a clash of cultures lead to seemingly inevitable conflict, Blackthorne's loyalty and strength of character are tested by both passion and loss, and he is torn between two worlds that will each be forever changed.Powerful and engrossing, capturing both the rich pageantry and stark realities of life in feudal Japan, Shōgun is a critically acclaimed powerhouse of a book. Heart-stopping, edge-of-your-seat action melds seamlessly with intricate historical detail and raw human emotion. Endlessly compelling, this sweeping saga captivated the world to become not only one of the best-selling novels of all time but also one of the highest-rated television miniseries, as well as inspiring a nationwide surge of interest in the culture of Japan. Shakespearean in both scope and depth, Shōgun is, as the New York Times put it, \"...not only something you read--you live it.\" Provocative, absorbing, and endlessly fascinating, there is only one: Shōgun.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1607736537i/52382796.jpg","asin":"1982603844","isbn":"1982603844","isbn13":"9781982603847","publisher":"Blackstone Publishing","ratingsCount":166583,"reviewsCount":5282,"numPages":1152,"rank":223,"year_publication":1975,"list_score":70915,"number_votes":867,"genres_list":"Historical Fiction, Japanese Literature, Historical, Fiction, Asia, Classics, Novels, Literature, Adventure, Japan","authors_list":"James Clavell","series_list":"Asian Saga: Chronological Order, Asian Saga: Publication Order","places_list":"Osaka, Tokyo, Ajiro","awards_list":"","Adult":false,"Adventure":true,"Audiobook":false,"Childrens":false,"Classics":true,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":true,"Historical":true,"Historical Fiction":true,"Literature":true,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":true,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":4.4,"filename":"book1476.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48855.The_Diary_of_a_Young_Girl","title":"The Diary of a Young Girl","titleComplete":"The Diary of a Young Girl","description":"Discovered in the attic in which she spent the last years of her life, Anne Frank’s remarkable diary has become a world classic—a powerful reminder of the horrors of war and an eloquent testament to the human spirit. In 1942, with the Nazis occupying Holland, a thirteen-year-old Jewish girl and her family fled their home in Amsterdam and went into hiding. For the next two years, until their whereabouts were betrayed to the Gestapo, the Franks and another family lived cloistered in the “Secret Annexe” of an old office building. Cut off from the outside world, they faced hunger, boredom, the constant cruelties of living in confined quarters, and the ever-present threat of discovery and death. In her diary Anne Frank recorded vivid impressions of her experiences during this period. By turns thoughtful, moving, and surprisingly humorous, her account offers a fascinating commentary on human courage and frailty and a compelling self-portrait of a sensitive and spirited young woman whose promise was tragically cut short.--back cover","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1560816565i/48855.jpg","publisher":"Bantam","ratingsCount":3436306,"reviewsCount":36879,"numPages":283,"language":"English","rank":222,"year_publication":1947,"list_score":71562,"number_votes":902,"genres_list":"Biography, Holocaust, Memoir, Historical, War, Autobiography, Classics, Nonfiction, History, World War II","authors_list":"Susan Massotty, Barbara Mooyaart-Doubleday, Eleanor Roosevelt, Γιάννης Θωμόπουλος, Otto H.

Wicked is about a land where animals talk and strive to be treated like first-class citizens, Munchkinlanders seek the comfort of middle-class stability, and the Tin Man becomes a victim of domestic violence. And then there is the little green-skinned girl named Elphaba, who will grow up to become the infamous Wicked Witch of the West, a smart, prickly, and misunderstood creature who challenges all our preconceived notions about the nature of good and evil.An astonishingly rich re-creation of the land of Oz, this book retells the story of Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West, who wasn't so wicked after all.

In David Copperfield - the novel he described as his 'favourite child' - Dickens drew revealingly on his own experiences to create one of the most exuberant and enduringly popular works, filled with tragedy and comedy in equal measure. This edition uses the text of the first volume publication of 1850, and includes updated suggestions for further reading, original illustrations by 'Phiz', a revised chronology and expanded notes. In his new introduction, Jeremy Tambling discusses the novel's autobiographical elements, and its central themes of memory and identity.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1461452762i/58696.jpg","publisher":"Penguin ","ratingsCount":222833,"reviewsCount":8356,"numPages":882,"language":"English","rank":213,"year_publication":1850,"list_score":75141,"number_votes":988,"genres_list":"Historical Fiction, 19th Century, Classic Literature, Fiction, Classics, Novels, Audiobook, British Literature, Literature, Victorian","authors_list":"Charles Dickens, Jeremy Tambling, Phiz, E.K.

When it is remembered that Chaucer wrote in English at a time when Latin was the standard literary language across western Europe, the magnitude of his achievement is even more remarkable. But Chaucer's genius needs no historical introduction; it bursts forth from every page of The Canterbury Tales.If we trust the General Prologue, Chaucer intended that each pilgrim should tell two tales on the way to Canterbury and two tales on the way back. He never finished his enormous project and even the completed tales were not finally revised. Scholars are uncertain about the order of the tales. As the printing press had yet to be invented when Chaucer wrote his works, The Canterbury Tales has been passed down in several handwritten manuscripts.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1261208589i/2696.jpg","asin":"0140424385","isbn":"0140424385","isbn13":"9780140424386","publisher":"Penguin Books/Penguin Classics","ratingsCount":211737,"reviewsCount":3979,"numPages":521,"language":"English","rank":210,"year_publication":1400,"list_score":76357,"number_votes":1017,"genres_list":"Historical Fiction, School, Read For School, Classic Literature, Fiction, Classics, Short Stories, Medieval, Literature, Poetry","authors_list":"Geoffrey Chaucer, Nevill Coghill","series_list":"","places_list":"England","awards_list":"","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":false,"Childrens":false,"Classics":true,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":true,"Historical":false,"Historical Fiction":true,"Literature":true,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":false,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":3.52,"filename":"book1489.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10799.A_Farewell_to_Arms","title":"A Farewell to Arms","titleComplete":"A Farewell to Arms","description":"A Farewell to Arms is the unforgettable story of an American ambulance driver on the Italian front and his passion for a beautiful English nurse.

A major achievement in 20th century literature.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1428891345i/338798.jpg","publisher":"Vintage","ratingsCount":121519,"reviewsCount":8536,"numPages":783,"language":"English","rank":202,"year_publication":1922,"list_score":81791,"number_votes":972,"genres_list":"20th Century, Fiction, Ireland, Classics, Banned Books, Novels, Unfinished, Literary Fiction, Irish Literature, Literature","authors_list":"James Joyce, John M.

From the moment young Jim Hawkins first encounters the sinister Blind Pew at the Admiral Benbow Inn until the climactic battle for treasure on a tropic isle, the novel creates scenes and characters that have fired the imaginations of generations of readers. Written by a superb prose stylist, a master of both action and atmosphere, the story centers upon the conflict between good and evil - but in this case a particularly engaging form of evil. It is the villainy of that most ambiguous rogue Long John Silver that sets the tempo of this tale of treachery, greed, and daring. Designed to forever kindle a dream of high romance and distant horizons, Treasure Island is, in the words of G. K. Chesterton, 'the realization of an ideal, that which is promised in its provocative and beckoning map; a vision not only of white skeletons but also green palm trees and sapphire seas.' G. S. Fraser terms it 'an utterly original book' and goes on to write: 'There will always be a place for stories like Treasure Island that can keep boys and old men happy.'","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1485248909i/295.jpg","asin":"0753453800","isbn":"0753453800","isbn13":"9780753453803","publisher":"Kingfisher","ratingsCount":459192,"reviewsCount":14775,"numPages":311,"language":"English","rank":198,"year_publication":1882,"list_score":83217,"number_votes":1116,"genres_list":"Historical Fiction, Pirates, Fiction, Classics, Novels, Young Adult, Childrens, Fantasy, Literature, Adventure","authors_list":"Robert Louis Stevenson, N.C.

After running away from the workhouse and pompous beadle Mr Bumble, Oliver finds himself lured into a den of thieves peopled by vivid and memorable characters - the Artful Dodger, vicious burglar Bill Sikes, his dog Bull's Eye, and prostitute Nancy, all watched over by cunning master-thief Fagin. Combining elements of Gothic Romance, the Newgate Novel and popular melodrama, Dickens created an entirely new kind of fiction, scathing in its indictment of a cruel society, and pervaded by an unforgettable sense of threat and mystery.This Penguin Classics edition of Oliver Twist is the first critical edition to faithfully reproduce the text as its earliest readers would have encountered it from its serialisation in Bentley's Miscellany, and includes an introduction by Philip Horne, a glossary of Victorian thieves' slang, a chronology of Dickens's life, a map of contemporary London and all of George Cruikshank's original illustrations.For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

The character lives beyond her means in order to escape the banalities and emptiness of provincial life. When the novel was first serialized in La Revue de Paris between 1 October 1856 and 15 December 1856, public prosecutors attacked the novel for obscenity. The resulting trial in January 1857 made the story notorious. After Flaubert's acquittal on 7 February 1857, Madame Bovary became a bestseller in April 1857 when it was published in two volumes. A seminal work of literary realism, the novel is now considered Flaubert's masterpiece, and one of the most influential literary works in history.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1606770119i/2175.jpg","asin":"0192840398","isbn":"0192840398","isbn13":"9780192840394","publisher":"Oxford University Press","ratingsCount":307311,"reviewsCount":14131,"numPages":329,"language":"French","rank":193,"year_publication":1856,"list_score":85213,"number_votes":1065,"genres_list":"Historical Fiction, French Literature, 19th Century, Classic Literature, Fiction, Classics, Novels, France, Romance, Literature","authors_list":"Eleanor Marx-Aveling, Mark Overstall, Margaret Mauldon, Malcolm Bowie, Gustave Flaubert","series_list":"","places_list":"France, Tostes, Yonville-l'Abbaye, Rouen","awards_list":"","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":false,"Childrens":false,"Classics":true,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":true,"Historical":false,"Historical Fiction":true,"Literature":true,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":true,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":true,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":3.7,"filename":"book1505.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/853510.Murder_on_the_Orient_Express","title":"Murder on the Orient Express","titleComplete":"Murder on the Orient Express (Hercule Poirot, #9)","description":"Just after midnight, a snowdrift stops the famous Orient Express in its tracks as it travels through the mountainous Balkans.

In 1949, four Chinese women, recent immigrants to San Francisco, meet weekly to play mahjong and tell stories of what they left behind in China. United in loss and new hope for their daughters' futures, they call themselves the Joy Luck Club. Their daughters, who have never heard these stories, think their mothers' advice is irrelevant to their modern American lives – until their own inner crises reveal how much they've unknowingly inherited of their mothers' pasts. With wit and sensitivity, Amy Tan examines the sometimes painful, often tender, and always deep connection between mothers and daughters.

And to a certain extent, he was. But I hadn't been able to forget a conversation he and I had once had. We'd both agreed that we'd rather be dead - truly dead - than walk the world as Strigoi. It was time to honor our words.Guardian Rose Hathaway's life will never be the same. The recent attack on St. Vladimir's Academy devastated the entire Moroi world. Many are dead. And, for the few victims carried off by Strigoi, their fates are even worse.

Rose must now choose one of two very different paths: honoring her life's vow to protect Lissa—her best friend and the last surviving Dragomir princess—or, dropping out of the Academy to strike out on her own and hunt down the man she loves. She'll have to go to the ends of the earth to find Dimitri and keep the promise he begged her to make.

Dumas transforms minor historical figures into larger- than-life characters: the Comte d’Artagnan, an impetuous young man in pursuit of glory; the beguilingly evil seductress “Milady”; the powerful and devious Cardinal Richelieu; the weak King Louis XIII and his unhappy queen—and, of course, the three musketeers themselves, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, whose motto “all for one, one for all” has come to epitomize devoted friendship.

Around the time Elizabeth Gilbert turned thirty, she went through an early-onslaught midlife crisis. She had everything an educated, ambitious American woman was supposed to want—a husband, a house, a successful career. But instead of feeling happy and fulfilled, she was consumed with panic, grief, and confusion. She went through a divorce, a crushing depression, another failed love, and the eradication of everything she ever thought she was supposed to be. To recover from all this, Gilbert took a radical step. In order to give herself the time and space to find out who she really was and what she really wanted, she got rid of her belongings, quit her job, and undertook a yearlong journey around the world—all alone. Eat, Pray, Love is the absorbing chronicle of that year. Her aim was to visit three places where she could examine one aspect of her own nature set against the backdrop of a culture that has traditionally done that one thing very well. In Rome, she studied the art of pleasure, learning to speak Italian and gaining the twenty-three happiest pounds of her life. India was for the art of devotion, and with the help of a native guru and a surprisingly wise cowboy from Texas, she embarked on four uninterrupted months of spiritual exploration. In Bali, she studied the art of balance between worldly enjoyment and divine transcendence. She became the pupil of an elderly medicine man and also fell in love the best way—unexpectedly. An intensely articulate and moving memoir of self-discovery, Eat, Pray, Love is about what can happen when you claim responsibility for your own contentment and stop trying to live in imitation of society’s ideals. It is certain to touch anyone who has ever woken up to the unrelenting need for change.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1503066414i/19501.jpg","asin":"0143038419","isbn":"0143038419","isbn13":"9780143038412","publisher":"Riverhead Books","ratingsCount":1664380,"reviewsCount":56643,"numPages":368,"language":"English","rank":166,"year_publication":2006,"list_score":102066,"number_votes":1180,"genres_list":"Contemporary, Biography, Memoir, Spirituality, Autobiography, Chick Lit, Romance, Nonfiction, Biography Memoir, Travel","authors_list":"Elizabeth Gilbert","series_list":"","places_list":"Southeast Asia, Italy, Ubud, Bali, Rome, Bali, Indonesia, India, New York City, New York","awards_list":"Puddly Award","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":false,"Childrens":false,"Classics":false,"Contemporary":true,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":false,"Historical":false,"Historical Fiction":false,"Literature":false,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":true,"Novels":false,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":true,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":3.61,"filename":"book1532.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18335634-clockwork-princess","title":"Clockwork Princess","titleComplete":"Clockwork Princess (The Infernal Devices, #3)","description":"Danger and betrayal, love and loss, secrets and enchantment are woven together in the breathtaking finale to the #1 New York Times bestselling Infernal Devices Trilogy, prequel to the internationally bestselling Mortal Instruments series.THE INFERNAL DEVICES WILL NEVER STOP COMINGA net of shadows begins to tighten around the Shadowhunters of the London Institute.

The whole Christmas season!Now, please don't ask why. No one quite knows the reason.\"Dr. Seuss's small-hearted Grinch ranks right up there with Scrooge when it comes to the crankiest, scowling holiday grumps of all time.For 53 years, the Grinch has lived in a cave on the side of a mountain, looming above the Whos in Whoville. The noisy holiday preparations and infernal singing of the happy little citizens below annoy him to no end. The Grinch decides this frivolous merriment must stop. His \"wonderful, awful\" idea is to don a Santa outfit, strap heavy antlers on his poor, quivering dog Max, construct a makeshift sleigh, head down to Whoville, and strip the chafingly cheerful Whos of their Yuletide glee once and for all.Looking quite out of place and very disturbing in his makeshift Santa get-up, the Grinch slithers down chimneys with empty bags and stealing the Whos' presents, their food, even the logs from their humble Who-fires. He takes the ramshackle sleigh to Mt. Crumpit to dump it and waits to hear the sobs of the Whos when they wake up and discover the trappings of Christmas have disappeared. Imagine the Whos' dismay when they discover the evil-doings of Grinch in his anti-Santa guise. But what is that sound? It's not sobbing, but singing! Children simultaneously adore and fear this triumphant, twisted Seussian testimonial to the undaunted cheerfulness of the Whos, the transcendent nature of joy, and of course, the growth potential of a heart that's two sizes too small. This holiday classic is perfect for reading aloud to your favorite little Whos.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327958149i/113946.jpg","asin":"0007173040","isbn":"0007173040","isbn13":"9780007173044","publisher":"Harper Collins Children's Books","ratingsCount":389532,"reviewsCount":4199,"numPages":64,"language":"English","rank":160,"year_publication":1957,"list_score":104172,"number_votes":1340,"genres_list":"Kids, Humor, Fiction, Picture Books, Christmas, Classics, Holiday, Childrens, Fantasy, Poetry","authors_list":"Dr. Seuss","series_list":"","places_list":"Who-ville, Mount Crumpit","awards_list":"","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":false,"Childrens":true,"Classics":true,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":true,"Fiction":true,"Historical":false,"Historical Fiction":false,"Literature":false,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":false,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":4.37,"filename":"book1537.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2120932.The_Battle_of_the_Labyrinth","title":"The Battle of the Labyrinth","titleComplete":"The Battle of the Labyrinth (Percy Jackson and the Olympians, #4)","description":"Percy Jackson isn't expecting freshman orientation to be any fun.

It begins in the early part of the 20th century, when Paddy Cleary moves his wife, Fiona, and their seven children to Drogheda, the vast Australian sheep station owned by his autocratic and childless older sister; and it ends more than half a century later, when the only survivor of the third generation, the brilliant actress Justine O'Neill, sets a course of life and love halfway around the world from her roots.The central figures in this enthralling story are the indomitable Meggie, the only Cleary daughter, and the one man she truly loves, the stunningly handsome and ambitious priest Ralph de Bricassart. Ralph's course moves him a long way indeed, from a remote Outback parish to the halls of the Vatican; and Meggie's except for a brief and miserable marriage elsewhere, is fixed to the Drogheda that is part of her bones - but distance does not dim their feelings though it shapes their lives.Wonderful characters people this book; strong and gentle, Paddy, hiding a private memory; dutiful Fiona, holding back love because it once betrayed her, violent, tormented Frank, and the other hardworking Cleary sons who give the boundless lands of Drogheda the energy and devotion most men save for women; Meggie; Ralph; and Meggie's children, Justine and Dane. And the land itself; stark, relentless in its demands, brilliant in its flowering, prey to gigantic cycles of drought and flood, rich when nature is bountiful, surreal like no other place on earth.Alternate Cover Edition ISBN 0380018179 (ISBN13: 9780380018178)","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1548530867i/3412.jpg","publisher":"Avon Books","ratingsCount":338829,"reviewsCount":7222,"numPages":692,"language":"English","rank":157,"year_publication":1977,"list_score":108552,"number_votes":1313,"genres_list":"Historical Fiction, Drama, Adult, Historical, Fiction, Classics, Novels, Historical Romance, Romance, Australia","authors_list":"Colleen McCullough","series_list":"","places_list":"Vatican City, Outback, Australia, New Zealand","awards_list":"","Adult":true,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":false,"Childrens":false,"Classics":true,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":true,"Historical":true,"Historical Fiction":true,"Literature":false,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":true,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":true,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":4.24,"filename":"book1540.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1423.The_Compleat_Works_of_Wllm_Shkspr","title":"The Compleat Works of Wllm Shkspr","titleComplete":"The Compleat Works of Wllm Shkspr (abridged)","description":"Revised from the rather long original complete works of Shakespeare, this abridged version is written by three Americans, with no qualifications worth speaking of.

Every April, when the wind blows in from the sea and mingles with the scent of lilacs, Landon Carter remembers his last year at Beaufort High. It was 1958, and Landon had already dated a girl or two. He even swore that he had once been in love. Certainly the last person in town he thought he'd fall for was Jamie Sullivan, the daughter of the town's Baptist minister. A quiet girl who always carried a Bible with her schoolbooks, Jamie seemed content living in a world apart from the other teens. She took care of her widowed father, rescued hurt animals, and helped out at the local orphanage. No boy had ever asked her out. Landon would never have dreamed of it. Then a twist of fate made Jamie his partner for the homecoming dance, and Landon Carter's life would never be the same. Being with Jamie would show him the depths of the human heart and lead him to a decision so stunning it would send him irrevocably on the road to manhood. No other author today touches our emotions more deeply than Nicholas Sparks.Illuminating both the strength and the gossamer fragility of our deepest emotions, his two New York Times bestsellers, The Notebook and Message in a Bottle, have established him as the leading author of today's most cherished love stories.

They offer a unique glimpse into life on the American frontier, and tell the heartwarming, unforgettable story of a loving family.Little House in the Big WoodsMeet the Ingalls family—Laura, Ma, Pa, Mary, and baby Carrie, who all live in a cozy log cabin in the big woods of Wisconsin in the 1870s. Though many of their neighbors are wolves and panthers and bears, the woods feel like home, thanks to Ma’s homemade cheese and butter and the joyful sounds of Pa’s fiddle.Farmer BoyAs Laura Ingalls is growing up in a little house in Kansas, Almanzo Wilder lives on a big farm in New York. He and his brothers and sisters work hard from dawn to supper to help keep their family farm running. Almanzo wishes for just one thing—his very own horse—but he must prove that he is ready for such a big responsibility.Little House on the PrairieWhen Pa decides to sell the log house in the woods, the family packs up and moves from Wisconsin to Kansas, where Pa builds them their little house on the prairie! Living on the farm is different from living in the woods, but Laura and her family are kept busy and are happy with the promise of their new life on the prairie.On the Banks of Plum CreekThe Ingalls family lives in a sod house beside Plum Creek in Minnesota until Pa builds them a new house made of sawed lumber. The money for the lumber will come from their first wheat crop. But then, just before the wheat is ready to harvest, a strange glittering cloud fills the sky, blocking out the sun. Millions of grasshoppers cover the field and everything on the farm, and by the end of a week, there is no wheat crop left.By the Shores of Silver LakePa Ingalls heads west to the unsettled wilderness of the Dakota Territory. When Ma, Mary, Laura, Carrie, and baby Grace join him, they become the first settlers in the town of De Smet. Pa starts work on the first building of the brand new town, located on the shores of Silver Lake. The Long WinterThe first terrible storm comes to the barren prairie in October. Then it snows almost without stopping until April. With snow piled as high as the rooftops, it’s impossible for trains to deliver supplies, and the townspeople, including Laura and her family, are starving. Young Almanzo Wilder, who has settled in the town, risks his life to save the town.Little Town on the PrairieDe Smet is rejuvenated with the beginning of spring. But in addition to the parties, socials, and “literaries,” work must continue. Laura spends many hours sewing shirts to help Ma and Pa get enough money to send Mary to a college for the blind. But in the evenings, Laura makes time for a new caller, Almanzo Wilder.These Happy Golden YearsLaura must continue to earn money to keep Mary in her college for the blind, so she gets a job as a teacher. It’s not easy, and for the first time she’s living away from home. But it gets a little better every Friday, when Almanzo picks Laura up to take her back home for the weekend. Though Laura is still young, she and Almanzo are officially courting, and she knows that this is a time for new beginnings.The First Four YearsLaura Ingalls and Almanzo Wilder have just been married!

Tom lives with his Aunt Polly, half-brother Sid, and cousin Mary in the quaint town of St. Petersburg, just off the shore of the Mississippi River. St. Petersburg is described as a typical small-town atmosphere where the Christian faith is predominant, the social network is close-knit, and familiarity resides.  Unlike his brother Sid, Tom receives \"lickings\" from his Aunt Polly; ever the mischief-maker, would rather play hooky than attend school and often sneaks out his bedroom window at night to adventure with his friend, Huckleberry Finn ­ the town's social outcast. Tom, despite his dread of schooling, is extremely clever and would normally get away with his pranks if Sid were not such a \"tattle-tale.\"  As punishment for skipping school to go swimming, Aunt Polly assigns Tom the chore of whitewashing the fence surrounding the house. In a brilliant scheme, Tom is able to con the neighborhood boys into completing the chore for him, managing to convince them of the joys of whitewashing. At school, Tom is equally as flamboyant, and attracts attention by chasing other boys, yelling, and running around. With his usual antics, Tom attempts to catch the eye of Becky Thatcher, a new girl in town, and persuades her to get \"engaged\" by kissing him. But their romance collapses when she learns Tom has been \"engaged\" previously to Amy Lawrence. Shortly after Becky shuns him, he accompanies Huckleberry Finn to the graveyard at night, where they witness the murder of Dr. Robinson.Excerpt:\"TOM!\" No answer. \"TOM!\" No answer. \"What's gone with that boy,  I wonder? You TOM!\" No answer. The old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the room; then she put them up and looked out under them. She seldom or never looked through them for so small a thing as a boy; they were her state pair, the pride of her heart, and were built for \"style,\" not service—she could have seen through a pair of stove-lids just as well. She looked perplexed for a moment, and then said, not fiercely, but still loud enough for the furniture to hear: \"Well, I lay if I get hold of you I'll—\" She did not finish, for by this time she was bending down and punching under the bed with the broom, and so she needed breath to punctuate the punches with.

It is the story of a young man who, transformed overnight into a giant beetle-like insect, becomes an object of disgrace to his family, an outsider in his own home, a quintessentially alienated man. A harrowing—though absurdly comic—meditation on human feelings of inadequacy, guilt, and isolation, The Metamorphosis has taken its place as one of the most widely read and influential works of twentieth-century fiction.

Its truths are so enduring that its language has become part of the common Russian speech.One hot spring, the devil arrives in Moscow, accompanied by a retinue that includes a beautiful naked witch and an immense talking black cat with a fondness for chess and vodka. The visitors quickly wreak havoc in a city that refuses to believe in either God or Satan. But they also bring peace to two unhappy Muscovites: one is the Master, a writer pilloried for daring to write a novel about Christ and Pontius Pilate; the other is Margarita, who loves the Master so deeply that she is willing literally to go to hell for him.

A Polar wind blows through it, and birds of prey hover over it.\" So Melville wrote of his masterpiece, one of the greatest works of imagination in literary history. In part, Moby-Dick is the story of an eerily compelling madman pursuing an unholy war against a creature as vast and dangerous and unknowable as the sea itself. But more than just a novel of adventure, more than an encyclopaedia of whaling lore and legend, the book can be seen as part of its author's lifelong meditation on America. Written with wonderfully redemptive humour, Moby-Dick is also a profound inquiry into character, faith, and the nature of perception.This edition of Moby-Dick, which reproduces the definitive text of the novel, includes invaluable explanatory notes, along with maps, illustrations, and a glossary of nautical terms.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327940656i/153747.jpg","asin":"0142437247","isbn":"0142437247","isbn13":"9780142437247","publisher":"Penguin Classics ","ratingsCount":529836,"reviewsCount":19980,"numPages":654,"language":"English","rank":107,"year_publication":1851,"list_score":214918,"number_votes":2479,"genres_list":"Historical Fiction, American, 19th Century, Classic Literature, Fiction, Classics, Novels, Audiobook, Literature, Adventure","authors_list":"Rockwell Kent, Andrew Delbanco, Tom Quirk, Herman Melville, Anton Lomaev, William Hootkins","series_list":"","places_list":"Nantucket, Massachusetts, New England, New Bedford, Massachusetts, Massachusetts, Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean","awards_list":"Audie Award, Премія імені Максима Рильського","Adult":false,"Adventure":true,"Audiobook":true,"Childrens":false,"Classics":true,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":true,"Historical":false,"Historical Fiction":true,"Literature":true,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":true,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":3.53,"filename":"book1591.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4473.A_Prayer_for_Owen_Meany","title":"A Prayer for Owen Meany","titleComplete":"A Prayer for Owen Meany","description":"Eleven-year-old Owen Meany, playing in a Little League baseball game in Gravesend, New Hampshire, hits a foul ball and kills his best friend's mother.

Was he a destroyer or the greatest of liberators?Why did he have to fight his battle, not against his enemies, but against those who needed him most, and his hardest battle against the woman he loved? What is the world’s motor — and the motive power of every man? You will know the answer to these questions when you discover the reason behind the baffling events that play havoc with the lives of the characters in this story. Tremendous in its scope, this novel presents an astounding panorama of human life — from the productive genius who becomes a worthless playboy — to the great steel industrialist who does not know that he is working for his own destruction — to the philosopher who becomes a pirate — to the composer who gives up his career on the night of his triumph — to the woman who runs a transcontinental railroad — to the lowest track worker in her Terminal tunnels. You must be prepared, when you read this novel, to check every premise at the root of your convictions.This is a mystery story, not about the murder — and rebirth — of man’s spirit.

Louis recounts how he became a vampire at the hands of the radiant and sinister Lestat and how he became indoctrinated, unwillingly, into the vampire way of life. His story ebbs and flows through the streets of New Orleans, defining crucial moments such as his discovery of the exquisite lost young child Claudia, wanting not to hurt but to comfort her with the last breaths of humanity he has inside. Yet, he makes Claudia a vampire, trapping her womanly passion, will, and intelligence inside the body of a small child. Louis and Claudia form a seemingly unbreakable alliance and even \"settle down\" for a while in the opulent French Quarter. Louis remembers Claudia's struggle to understand herself and the hatred they both have for Lestat that sends them halfway across the world to seek others of their kind. Louis and Claudia are desperate to find somewhere they belong, to find others who understand, and someone who knows what and why they are.Louis and Claudia travel Europe, eventually coming to Paris and the ragingly successful Theatre des Vampires--a theatre of vampires pretending to be mortals pretending to be vampires. Here they meet the magnetic and ethereal Armand, who brings them into a whole society of vampires. But Louis and Claudia find that finding others like themselves provides no easy answers and in fact presents dangers they scarcely imagined.Originally begun as a short story, the book took off as Anne wrote it, spinning the tragic and triumphant life experiences of a soul. As well as the struggles of its characters, Interview captures the political and social changes of two continents. The novel also introduces Lestat, Anne's most enduring character, a heady mixture of attraction and revulsion. The book, full of lush description, centers on the themes of immortality, change, loss, sexuality, and power.source: annerice.com","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1380631642i/43763.jpg","asin":"0345476875","isbn":"0345476875","isbn13":"9780345476876","publisher":"Ballantine Books","ratingsCount":551203,"reviewsCount":13726,"numPages":346,"language":"English","rank":98,"year_publication":1976,"list_score":276989,"number_votes":3099,"genres_list":"Historical Fiction, Gothic, Urban Fantasy, Paranormal, Fiction, Classics, Supernatural, Vampires, Fantasy, Horror","authors_list":"Anne Rice","series_list":"The Vampire Chronicles","places_list":"Paris, Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana","awards_list":"British Fantasy Award","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":false,"Childrens":false,"Classics":true,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":true,"Fiction":true,"Historical":false,"Historical Fiction":true,"Literature":false,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":false,"Paranormal":true,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":true,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":true,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":4.01,"filename":"book1600.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23919.The_Complete_Stories_and_Poems","title":"The Complete Stories and Poems","titleComplete":"The Complete Stories and Poems","description":"This single volume brings together all of Poe's stories and poems, and illuminates the diverse and multifaceted genius of one of the greatest and most influential figures in American literary history.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327942676i/23919.jpg","asin":"0385074077","isbn":"0385074077","isbn13":"9780385074070","publisher":"Doubleday & Company, Inc.","ratingsCount":243357,"reviewsCount":2157,"numPages":821,"language":"English","rank":96,"year_publication":1849,"list_score":277735,"number_votes":3153,"genres_list":"Mystery, Gothic, Classic Literature, Fiction, Classics, Short Stories, Fantasy, Horror, Literature, Poetry","authors_list":"Edgar Allan Poe","series_list":"","places_list":"The United States of America","awards_list":"","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":false,"Childrens":false,"Classics":true,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":true,"Fiction":true,"Historical":false,"Historical Fiction":false,"Literature":true,"Magic":false,"Mystery":true,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":false,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":4.38,"filename":"book1601.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11588.The_Shining","title":"The Shining","titleComplete":"The Shining","description":"Jack Torrance's new job at the Overlook Hotel is the perfect chance for a fresh start.

Their host, an eccentric millionaire unknown to all of them, is nowhere to be found. All that the guests have in common is a wicked past they're unwilling to reveal—and a secret that will seal their fate. For each has been marked for murder. A famous nursery rhyme is framed and hung in every room of the mansion:\"Ten little boys went out to dine; One choked his little self and then there were nine. Nine little boys sat up very late; One overslept himself and then there were eight. Eight little boys traveling in Devon; One said he'd stay there then there were seven. Seven little boys chopping up sticks; One chopped himself in half and then there were six. Six little boys playing with a hive; A bumblebee stung one and then there were five. Five little boys going in for law; One got in Chancery and then there were four. Four little boys going out to sea; A red herring swallowed one and then there were three. Three little boys walking in the zoo; A big bear hugged one and then there were two. Two little boys sitting in the sun; One got frizzled up and then there was one. One little boy left all alone; He went out and hanged himself and then there were none.\"When they realize that murders are occurring as described in the rhyme, terror mounts. One by one they fall prey. Before the weekend is out, there will be none. Who has choreographed this dastardly scheme? And who will be left to tell the tale? Only the dead are above suspicion.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1638425885i/16299.jpg","asin":"0312330871","isbn":"0312330871","isbn13":"9780312330873","publisher":"St. Martin's Press","ratingsCount":1179037,"reviewsCount":53355,"numPages":264,"language":"English","rank":94,"year_publication":1939,"list_score":280021,"number_votes":3092,"genres_list":"Mystery, Crime, Fiction, Classics, Mystery Thriller, Suspense, Novels, Audiobook, Adult, Detective","authors_list":"Agatha Christie","series_list":"","places_list":"England, Devon, England, United Kingdom, Devon Coast, England","awards_list":"","Adult":true,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":true,"Childrens":false,"Classics":true,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":true,"Historical":false,"Historical Fiction":false,"Literature":false,"Magic":false,"Mystery":true,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":true,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":4.28,"filename":"book1603.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/830502.It","title":"It","titleComplete":"It","description":"Welcome to Derry, Maine ...It’s a small city, a place as hauntingly familiar as your own hometown.

This is a glorious book that bears all the marks of a classic.\"When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I managed to survive at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood.\" So begins the Pulitzer Prize winning memoir of Frank McCourt, born in Depression-era Brooklyn to recent Irish immigrants and raised in the slums of Limerick, Ireland. Frank's mother, Angela, has no money to feed the children since Frank's father, Malachy, rarely works, and when he does he drinks his wages. Yet Malachy—exasperating, irresponsible and beguiling—does nurture in Frank an appetite for the one thing he can provide: a story. Frank lives for his father's tales of Cuchulain, who saved Ireland, and of the Angel on the Seventh Step, who brings his mother babies. Perhaps it is story that accounts for Frank's survival. Wearing rags for diapers, begging a pig's head for Christmas dinner and gathering coal from the roadside to light a fire, Frank endures poverty, near-starvation and the casual cruelty of relatives and neighbors—yet lives to tell his tale with eloquence, exuberance and remarkable forgiveness. Angela's Ashes, imbued on every page with Frank McCourt's astounding humor and compassion, is a glorious book that bears all the marks of a classic.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348317139i/252577.jpg","asin":"0007205236","isbn":"0007205236","isbn13":"9780007205233","publisher":"Harper Perennial","ratingsCount":603576,"reviewsCount":13433,"numPages":452,"language":"English","rank":88,"year_publication":1996,"list_score":300259,"number_votes":3350,"genres_list":"Biography, Memoir, Historical, History, Ireland, Autobiography, Classics, Irish Literature, Nonfiction, Biography Memoir","authors_list":"Frank McCourt","series_list":"Frank McCourt","places_list":"Ireland, Limerick, New York (State)","awards_list":"Pulitzer Prize, American Booksellers Book Of The Year  Award, Audie Award, Los Angeles Times Book Prize, Exclusive Books Boeke Prize, National Book Critics Circle Award","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":false,"Childrens":false,"Classics":true,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":false,"Historical":true,"Historical Fiction":false,"Literature":false,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":true,"Novels":false,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":4.14,"filename":"book1609.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6288.The_Road","title":"The Road","titleComplete":"The Road","description":"A searing, postapocalyptic novel destined to become Cormac McCarthy’s masterpiece.A father and his son walk alone through burned America. Nothing moves in the ravaged landscape save the ash on the wind. It is cold enough to crack stones, and when the snow falls it is gray. The sky is dark. Their destination is the coast, although they don’t know what, if anything, awaits them there. They have nothing; just a pistol to defend themselves against the lawless bands that stalk the road, the clothes they are wearing, a cart of scavenged food—and each other.The Road is the profoundly moving story of a journey. It boldly imagines a future in which no hope remains, but in which the father and his son, “each the other’s world entire,” are sustained by love. Awesome in the totality of its vision, it is an unflinching meditation on the worst and the best that we are capable of: ultimate destructiveness, desperate tenacity, and the tenderness that keeps two people alive in the face of total devastation.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1600241424i/6288.jpg","asin":"0307265439","isbn":"0307265439","isbn13":"9780307265432","publisher":"Alfred A.

Anna is a sophisticated woman who abandons her empty existence as the wife of Karenin and turns to Count Vronsky to fulfil her passionate nature - with tragic consequences. Levin is a reflection of Tolstoy himself, often expressing the author's own views and convictions.Throughout, Tolstoy points no moral, merely inviting us not to judge but to watch.

Now she tells the emotionally riveting story of a family torn apart by conflicting needs and a passionate love that triumphs over human weakness. Anna is not sick, but she might as well be. By age 13 she has undergone countless surgeries, transfusions, and shots so that her older sister, Kate, can somehow fight the leukemia that has plagued her since childhood. The product of preimplantation genetic diagnosis, Anna was conceived as a bone marrow match for Kate—a life and a role that she has never challenged ... until now. Like most teenagers, Anna is beginning to question who she truly is. But unlike most teenagers, she has always been defined in terms of her sister—and so Anna makes a decision that for most would be unthinkable, a decision that will tear her family apart and have perhaps fatal consequences for the sister she loves. My Sister's Keeper examines what it means to be a good parent, a good sister, a good person. Is it morally correct to do whatever it takes to save a child's life, even if that means infringing upon the rights of another? Is it worth trying to discover who you really are if that quest makes you like yourself less? Should you follow your own heart or let others lead you? Once again, in My Sister's Keeper, Jodi Picoult tackles a controversial real-life subject with grace, wisdom, and sensitivity.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1369504683i/10917.jpg","asin":"0743454537","isbn":"0743454537","isbn13":"9780743454537","publisher":"Washington Square Press","ratingsCount":1166498,"reviewsCount":35702,"numPages":423,"language":"English","rank":82,"year_publication":2004,"list_score":357619,"number_votes":3934,"genres_list":"Contemporary, Drama, Adult Fiction, Realistic Fiction, Fiction, Novels, Chick Lit, Young Adult, Adult, Family","authors_list":"Jodi Picoult","series_list":"","places_list":"Providence, Rhode Island, The United States of America, Rhode Island","awards_list":"Audie Award, Pennsylvania Young Readers' Choice Award, ALA Alex Award, Lincoln Award, Green Mountain Book Award, Gateway Readers Award","Adult":true,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":false,"Childrens":false,"Classics":false,"Contemporary":true,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":true,"Historical":false,"Historical Fiction":false,"Literature":false,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":true,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":true,"avgRating":4.09,"filename":"book1615.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52892857-the-color-purple","title":"The Color Purple","titleComplete":"The Color Purple","description":"Winner of the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award. Alice Walker's iconic modern classic is now a Penguin Book.A powerful cultural touchstone of modern American literature, The Color Purple depicts the lives of African American women in early twentieth-century rural Georgia. Separated as girls, sisters Celie and Nettie sustain their loyalty to and hope in each other across time, distance and silence. Through a series of letters spanning twenty years, first from Celie to God, then the sisters to each other despite the unknown, the novel draws readers into its rich and memorable portrayals of Celie, Nettie, Shug Avery and Sofia and their experience. The Color Purple broke the silence around domestic and sexual abuse, narrating the lives of women through their pain and struggle, companionship and growth, resilience and bravery.

But what makes The Pillars of the Earth extraordinary is the time the twelfth century; the place feudal England; and the subject the building of a glorious cathedral. Follett has re-created the crude, flamboyant England of the Middle Ages in every detail. The vast forests, the walled towns, the castles, and the monasteries become a familiar landscape. Against this richly imagined and intricately interwoven backdrop, filled with the ravages of war and the rhythms of daily life, the master storyteller draws the reader irresistibly into the intertwined lives of his characters into their dreams, their labors, and their loves: Tom, the master builder; Aliena, the ravishingly beautiful noblewoman; Philip, the prior of Kingsbridge; Jack, the artist in stone; and Ellen, the woman of the forest who casts a terrifying curse. From humble stonemason to imperious monarch, each character is brought vividly to life.The building of the cathedral, with the almost eerie artistry of the unschooled stonemasons, is the center of the drama. Around the site of the construction, Follett weaves a story of betrayal, revenge, and love, which begins with the public hanging of an innocent man and ends with the humiliation of a king.For the TV tie-in edition with the same ISBN go to this Alternate Cover Edition","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1576956100i/5043.jpg","publisher":"NAL Trade","ratingsCount":724328,"reviewsCount":35279,"numPages":976,"language":"English","rank":72,"year_publication":1989,"list_score":413197,"number_votes":4443,"genres_list":"Historical Fiction, Audiobook, Historical, Fiction, Classics, Novels, Fantasy, Adult, Medieval, British Literature","authors_list":"Ken Follett","series_list":"Kingsbridge","places_list":"England","awards_list":"","Adult":true,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":true,"Childrens":false,"Classics":true,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":true,"Fiction":true,"Historical":true,"Historical Fiction":true,"Literature":false,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":true,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":4.33,"filename":"book1627.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6514.The_Bell_Jar","title":"The Bell Jar","titleComplete":"The Bell Jar","description":"The Bell Jar chronicles the crack-up of Esther Greenwood: brilliant, beautiful, enormously talented, and successful, but slowly going under—maybe for the last time.

Yet if Yossarian makes any attempt to excuse himself from the perilous missions he’s assigned, he’ll be in violation of Catch-22, a hilariously sinister bureaucratic rule: a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but if he makes a formal request to be removed from duty, he is proven sane and therefore ineligible to be relieved.This fiftieth-anniversary edition commemorates Joseph Heller’s masterpiece with a new introduction by Christopher Buckley; a wealth of critical essays and reviews by Norman Mailer, Alfred Kazin, Anthony Burgess, and others; rare papers and photos from Joseph Heller’s personal archive; and much more. Here, at last, is the definitive edition of a classic of world literature.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1463157317i/168668.jpg","asin":"0684833395","isbn":"0684833395","isbn13":"9780684833392","publisher":"Simon & Schuster ","ratingsCount":797805,"reviewsCount":21534,"numPages":453,"language":"English","rank":68,"year_publication":1961,"list_score":426470,"number_votes":4652,"genres_list":"Historical Fiction, Humor, American, War, Fiction, Historical, Classics, Novels, Unfinished, Literature","authors_list":"Joseph Heller","series_list":"Catch-22","places_list":"Italy","awards_list":"National Book Award Finalist","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":false,"Childrens":false,"Classics":true,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":true,"Historical":true,"Historical Fiction":true,"Literature":true,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":true,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":3.99,"filename":"book1629.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/149267.The_Stand","title":"The Stand","titleComplete":"The Stand","description":"First came the days of the plague.

While her father, the freethinking reformer and abolitionist Bronson Alcott, hobnobbed with such eminent male authors as Emerson, Thoreau, and Hawthorne, Louisa supported herself and her sisters with \"woman’s work,” including sewing, doing laundry, and acting as a domestic servant. But she soon discovered she could make more money writing. Little Women brought her lasting fame and fortune, and far from being the \"girl’s book” her publisher requested, it explores such timeless themes as love and death, war and peace, the conflict between personal ambition and family responsibilities, and the clash of cultures between Europe and America.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1562690475i/1934.jpg","asin":"0451529308","publisher":"Signet Classics","ratingsCount":2052129,"reviewsCount":43368,"numPages":449,"language":"English","rank":54,"year_publication":1868,"list_score":529062,"number_votes":5896,"genres_list":"Historical Fiction, Audiobook, Historical, Fiction, Classic Literature, Classics, Young Adult, Childrens, Romance, Literature","authors_list":"Marta Fihel, Grzegorz Komerski, Louisa May Alcott, Regina Barreca","series_list":"Little Women","places_list":"Massachusetts, New England, London, England, Concord, Massachusetts","awards_list":"","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":true,"Childrens":true,"Classics":true,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":true,"Historical":true,"Historical Fiction":true,"Literature":true,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":false,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":true,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":true,"avgRating":4.13,"filename":"book1642.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23772.Green_Eggs_and_Ham","title":"Green Eggs and Ham","titleComplete":"Green Eggs and Ham","description":"“Do you like green eggs and ham?” asks Sam-I-am in this Beginner Book by Dr. Seuss.

In the myths and legends that are retold here, Fagles has captured the energy and poetry of Homer's original in a bold, contemporary idiom, and given us an Odyssey to read aloud, to savor, and to treasure for its sheer lyrical mastery.Renowned classicist Bernard Knox's superb Introduction and textual commentary provide new insights and background information for the general reader and scholar alike, intensifying the strength of Fagles' translation.This is an Odyssey to delight both the classicist and the public at large, and to captivate a new generation of Homer's students.--Robert Fagles, winner of the PEN/Ralph Manheim Medal for Translation and a 1996 Academy Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, presents us with Homer's best-loved and most accessible poem in a stunning new modern-verse translation.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1390173285i/1381.jpg","asin":"0143039954","isbn":"0143039954","isbn13":"9780143039952","publisher":"Penguin Classics ","ratingsCount":1004197,"reviewsCount":16556,"numPages":541,"language":"English","rank":49,"year_publication":-700,"list_score":559387,"number_votes":6126,"genres_list":"Historical Fiction, School, Read For School, Fiction, Classics, Mythology, Fantasy, Literature, Adventure, Poetry","authors_list":"Robert Fagles, Philip Stanhope Worsley, Samuel Butler, George Chapman, Homer, Ιάκωβος Πολυλάς, Andrew Lang, Bernard Knox, William Walter Merry, Otmar Vaňorný","series_list":"","places_list":"Ithaca","awards_list":"","Adult":false,"Adventure":true,"Audiobook":false,"Childrens":false,"Classics":true,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":true,"Fiction":true,"Historical":false,"Historical Fiction":true,"Literature":true,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":false,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":3.8,"filename":"book1648.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33574273-a-wrinkle-in-time","title":"A Wrinkle in Time","titleComplete":"A Wrinkle in Time (Time Quintet, #1)","description":"It was a dark and stormy night.Out of this wild night, a strange visitor comes to the Murry house and beckons Meg, her brother Charles Wallace, and their friend Calvin O'Keefe on a most dangerous and extraordinary adventure—one that will threaten their lives and our universe.Winner of the 1963 Newbery Medal, A Wrinkle in Time is the first book in Madeleine L'Engle's classic Time Quintet.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1507963312i/33574273.jpg","asin":"1250153271","isbn":"1250153271","isbn13":"9781250153272","publisher":"Square Fish","ratingsCount":1143474,"reviewsCount":37362,"numPages":218,"language":"English","rank":48,"year_publication":1962,"list_score":602544,"number_votes":6438,"genres_list":"Science Fiction Fantasy, Fiction, Childrens, Classics, Time Travel, Young Adult, Fantasy, Science Fiction, Middle Grade, Adventure","authors_list":"Madeleine L'Engle","series_list":"Kairos, Time Quintet, Glencoe Literature Library","places_list":"Connecticut","awards_list":"Newbery Medal, Vermont Golden Dome Book Award, Oklahoma Sequoyah Award, Margaret A.

The novel tells the story of Ponyboy Curtis and his struggles with right and wrong in a society in which he believes that he is an outsider. According to Ponyboy, there are two kinds of people in the world: greasers and socs. A soc (short for \"social\") has money, can get away with just about anything, and has an attitude longer than a limousine. A greaser, on the other hand, always lives on the outside and needs to watch his back. Ponyboy is a greaser, and he's always been proud of it, even willing to rumble against a gang of socs for the sake of his fellow greasers--until one terrible night when his friend Johnny kills a soc. The murder gets under Ponyboy's skin, causing his bifurcated world to crumble and teaching him that pain feels the same whether a soc or a greaser.Librarian note: This record is for one of the three editions published with different covers and with ISBN 0-140-38572-X / 978-0-14-038572-4.

In a land where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning, and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister forces are massing beyond the kingdom’s protective Wall. To the south, the king’s powers are failing—his most trusted adviser dead under mysterious circumstances and his enemies emerging from the shadows of the throne. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the frozen land they were born to. Now Lord Eddard Stark is reluctantly summoned to serve as the king’s new Hand, an appointment that threatens to sunder not only his family but the kingdom itself.Sweeping from a harsh land of cold to a summertime kingdom of epicurean plenty, A Game of Thrones tells a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards, who come together in a time of grim omens. Here an enigmatic band of warriors bear swords of no human metal; a tribe of fierce wildlings carry men off into madness; a cruel young dragon prince barters his sister to win back his throne; a child is lost in the twilight between life and death; and a determined woman undertakes a treacherous journey to protect all she holds dear. Amid plots and counter-plots, tragedy and betrayal, victory and terror, allies and enemies, the fate of the Starks hangs perilously in the balance, as each side endeavors to win that deadliest of conflicts: the game of thrones.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1562726234i/13496.jpg","asin":"0553588486","isbn":"0553588486","isbn13":"9780553588484","publisher":"Bantam","ratingsCount":2327849,"reviewsCount":59841,"numPages":835,"language":"English","rank":46,"year_publication":1996,"list_score":630857,"number_votes":6728,"genres_list":"Science Fiction Fantasy, Epic Fantasy, Audiobook, Fiction, Epic, Fantasy, Adult, High Fantasy, Dragons, Adventure","authors_list":"George R.R.

The city is beautiful and terrible, in all its neon loneliness and seedy glamour, its mingled sense of possibility and emptiness. Holden passes through it like a ghost, thinking always of his kid sister Phoebe, the only person who really understands him, and his determination to escape the phonies and find a life of true meaning.The Catcher in the Rye is an all-time classic in coming-of-age literature- an elegy to teenage alienation, capturing the deeply human need for connection and the bewildering sense of loss as we leave childhood behind.\n  J.D.

It was named by Modern Library and its readers as one of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.

Yet they have formed a \"family,\" clinging together in the face of loneliness and alienation. Laborers in California's dusty vegetable fields, they hustle work when they can, living a hand-to-mouth existence. But George and Lennie have a plan: to own an acre of land and a shack they can call their own.While the powerlessness of the laboring class is a recurring theme in Steinbeck's work of the late 1930s, he narrowed his focus when composing 'Of Mice and Men' (1937), creating an intimate portrait of two men facing a world marked by petty tyranny, misunderstanding, jealousy, and callousness. But though the scope is narrow, the theme is universal: a friendship and a shared dream that makes an individual's existence meaningful.A unique perspective on life's hardships, this story has achieved the status of timeless classic due to its remarkable success as a novel, a Broadway play, and three acclaimed films.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1511302904i/890.jpg","asin":"0142000671","isbn":"0142000671","isbn13":"9780142000670","publisher":"Penguin Books","ratingsCount":2358477,"reviewsCount":45416,"numPages":103,"language":"English","rank":36,"year_publication":1937,"list_score":730920,"number_votes":7881,"genres_list":"Historical Fiction, School, Read For School, American, Historical, Fiction, High School, Classics, Novels, Literature","authors_list":"John Steinbeck","series_list":"","places_list":"Salinas Valley, California, California","awards_list":"New York Drama Critics' Circle Award","Adult":false,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":false,"Childrens":false,"Classics":true,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":true,"Historical":true,"Historical Fiction":true,"Literature":true,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":true,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":false,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":3.88,"filename":"book1661.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17245.Dracula","title":"Dracula","titleComplete":"Dracula","description":"You can find an alternative cover edition for this ISBN here and here.When Jonathan Harker visits Transylvania to help Count Dracula with the purchase of a London house, he makes a series of horrific discoveries about his client.

The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother Ender fails.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1408303130i/375802.jpg","asin":"0812550706","isbn":"0812550706","isbn13":"9780812550702","publisher":"Tor","ratingsCount":1294981,"reviewsCount":47103,"numPages":324,"language":"English","rank":33,"year_publication":1985,"list_score":758397,"number_votes":7908,"genres_list":"Science Fiction Fantasy, Audiobook, War, Classics, Novels, Young Adult, Fantasy, Science Fiction, Adventure, Dystopia","authors_list":"Orson Scott Card","series_list":"The Enderverse, Enderverse:  Publication Order, Ender's Saga","places_list":"Outer Space","awards_list":"Hugo Award, Nebula Award, Premio Ignotus, Premi Ictineu, Margaret A.

She may have a degree, but it is 1962, Mississippi, and her mother will not be happy till Skeeter has a ring on her finger. Skeeter would normally find solace with her beloved maid Constantine, the woman who raised her, but Constantine has disappeared and no one will tell Skeeter where she has gone.Aibileen is a black maid, a wise, regal woman raising her seventeenth white child. Something has shifted inside her after the loss of her own son, who died while his bosses looked the other way. She is devoted to the little girl she looks after, though she knows both their hearts may be broken.Minny, Aibileen's best friend, is short, fat, and perhaps the sassiest woman in Mississippi. She can cook like nobody's business, but she can't mind her tongue, so she's lost yet another job. Minny finally finds a position working for someone too new to town to know her reputation. But her new boss has secrets of her own.Seemingly as different from one another as can be, these women will nonetheless come together for a clandestine project that will put them all at risk. And why? Because they are suffocating within the lines that define their town and their times. And sometimes lines are made to be crossed.In pitch-perfect voices, Kathryn Stockett creates three extraordinary women whose determination to start a movement of their own forever changes a town, and the way women, mothers, daughters, caregivers, friends, view one another. A deeply moving novel filled with poignancy, humor, and hope, The Help is a timeless and universal story about the lines we abide by, and the ones we don't.

Anne Shirley, an eleven-year-old orphan, has arrived in this verdant corner of Prince Edward Island only to discover that the Cuthberts—elderly Matthew and his stern sister, Marilla—want to adopt a boy, not a feisty redheaded girl.

For over a century, this mesmerizing tale of horror and suspense has enjoyed wide popularity.

The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV.Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister's place in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before—and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weight survival against humanity and life against love.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1586722975i/2767052.jpg","asin":"0439023483","isbn":"0439023483","isbn13":"9780439023481","publisher":"Scholastic Press","ratingsCount":7829178,"reviewsCount":191084,"numPages":374,"language":"English","rank":1,"year_publication":2008,"list_score":3426621,"number_votes":34887,"genres_list":"Teen, Audiobook, Fiction, Post Apocalyptic, Young Adult, Fantasy, Romance, Science Fiction, Adventure, Dystopia","authors_list":"Suzanne Collins","series_list":"The Hunger Games","places_list":"Panem, District 12, Panem, Capitol, Panem","awards_list":"Locus Award, Georgia Peach Book Award, Buxtehuder Bulle, Golden Duck Award, Grand Prix de l'Imaginaire, Books I Loved Best Yearly (BILBY) Awards, West Australian Young Readers' Book Award (WAYRBA), Red House Children's Book Award, South Carolina Book Award, Charlotte Award, Colorado Blue Spruce Young Adult Book Award, Teen Buckeye Book Award, Pennsylvania Young Readers' Choice Award, Rhode Island Teen Book Award, Vermont Golden Dome Book Award, Evergreen Teen Book Award, Soaring Eagle Book Award, Milwaukee County Teen Book Award, Sakura Medal, Michigan Library Association Thumbs Up!

Jane Austen called this brilliant work \"her own darling child\" and its vivacious heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, \"as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print.\" The romantic clash between the opinionated Elizabeth and her proud beau, Mr. Darcy, is a splendid performance of civilized sparring. And Jane Austen's radiant wit sparkles as her characters dance a delicate quadrille of flirtation and intrigue, making this book the most superb comedy of manners of Regency England.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320399351i/1885.jpg","publisher":"Modern Library","ratingsCount":3869869,"reviewsCount":96817,"numPages":279,"language":"English","rank":3,"year_publication":1813,"list_score":2440581,"number_votes":25072,"genres_list":"Historical Fiction, Adult, Historical, Fiction, Classics, Novels, Historical Romance, Audiobook, Romance, Literature","authors_list":"Anna Quindlen, Jane Austen","series_list":"","places_list":"Derbyshire, England, England, Hertfordshire, England, United Kingdom","awards_list":"","Adult":true,"Adventure":false,"Audiobook":true,"Childrens":false,"Classics":true,"Contemporary":false,"Fantasy":false,"Fiction":true,"Historical":true,"Historical Fiction":true,"Literature":true,"Magic":false,"Mystery":false,"Nonfiction":false,"Novels":true,"Paranormal":false,"Romance":true,"Science Fiction":false,"Science Fiction Fantasy":false,"Supernatural":false,"Thriller":false,"Urban Fantasy":false,"Young Adult":false,"avgRating":4.28,"filename":"book1696.jpg"},{"url":"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/196970.The_Night_Before_Christmas","title":"The Night Before Christmas","titleComplete":"The Night Before Christmas","description":"This poem first appeared in a newspaper in Troy, New York, USA, on December 23, 1823, as \"A Visit From St. Nicholas\".

Unbeknownst to him, his housekeeper had sent it to the newspaper to be published. However, the family of Henry Livingston Jr. contended that their father had been reciting “A Visit from St. Nicholas” for 15 years prior to publication. Regardless of the true author, the poem is now a Christmas classic.","imageUrl":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388370094i/196970.jpg","asin":"0399231900","isbn":"0399231900","isbn13":"9780399231902","publisher":"G.P.
